Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Oridonin in the Treatment of Laryngeal Cancer: A Comprehensive Strategy Involving Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking, Dynamic Simulation, and Experimental Verification.	Laryngeal cancer (LC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the head and neck, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Oridonin (Ori), a natural tetracyclic diterpenoid, exhibits notable anti-tumor properties. However, its efficacy and underlying mechanism in LC remain to be elucidated. This study employed comprehensive network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation to investigate the molecular targets and mechanisms underlying the anti-LC effects of Ori, followed by in vitro validation of its key mechanisms. A total of 172 potential therapeutic targets of Ori for LC were identified. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that Ori's anti-LC mechanism primarily involved the PI3K-Akt, Ras, MAPK, and Rap1 signaling pathways. The PPI network and molecular docking analyses revealed that AKT1, EGFR, and MAPK1 are potential core targets of Ori. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations and bioinformatics analyses further confirmed that these proteins are key candidate targets. In vitro, Ori inhibited the proliferation of LC Hep-2 and TU212 cells, induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase, and suppressed migration and invasion. WB assays further showed that Ori significantly downregulated p-AKT expression in the PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings indicate that Ori represents a promising therapeutic candidate for LC.

Quantitative vs Qualitative analysis of breast lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	BACKGROUND: Dynamic contrast enhancement-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is becoming increasingly significant for identifying and characterizing breast lesions. It can also provide insight into functional parameters, such as enhancement kinetics and tissue perfusion parameters, including Ktrans, Ve, and Kep. AIM: This study explores the role of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of DCE-MRI in enhancing diagnostic accuracy for distin-guishing between benign and malignant breast lesions, contributing to more precise breast cancer diagnosis and management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study was performed on 47 patients with breast lesions. MRI Breast was performed on a closed 3T MRI scanner equipped with a dedicated 18-channel breast coil. MRI study protocol included conventional Breast MRI and DCE sequences. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistics software package version 28.0. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients, with an age range of 17 to 70 years old, were included in the study. The sensitivity of kinetic curve analysis was 94.74 %, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 72 %, and negative predictive value of 95.45 % to distinguish benign and mali-gnant breast lesions. The mean Ktrans value of benign breast lesions was 0.447+1.55/min and 0.496+1.08 / min (p-value <0.04) for malignant lesions. The mean Kep value of benign breast lesions was 2.984+8.27/ min, and for malignant lesions was 3.424+8.70/ min (p-value <0.008). The mean Ve value did not show a significant value in distinguishing benign and malignant breast lesions (p-value <0.386). Kep cut-off value at 0.279 and Ktrans cut-off value at 0.73 depicted the highest area under the curve (AUC). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating qualitative and quantitative data provides a more comprehensive understanding of breast lesions, ultimately leading to more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment strategies.

Genetic Testing for All Breast Cancer Patients: The GET FACTS Randomized Clinical Trial.	IMPORTANCE: Increasing germline genetic testing rates may impact contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of a personalized contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk counseling tool that incorporates genetic testing results. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial recruited participants from a single tertiary referral center between June 8, 2020, and December 31, 2022. Patients aged 18 to 80 years with unilateral breast cancer who underwent genetic counseling and surgery were eligible. Exclusion criteria were prior or metastatic breast cancer or prior multigene panel testing. Follow-up was completed June 30, 2023. INTERVENTION: Personalized age-specific CBC risks were estimated based on the presence or absence of pathogenic variants associated with breast cancer and were incorporated into a visual decision support tool. Patients were randomized 1:1 to quantitative counseling via the tool vs standard counseling without personalized CBC risk estimates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Co-primary end points included patients' personal CBC risk knowledge and propensity to undergo CPM, before and after counseling, by randomization arm. The secondary end point was CPM rate. Sample size calculations assumed postcounseling CBC risk self-assessments would be 5% different from baseline (SD, 20%). A total of 199 patients in each arm would achieve 80% power and 5% type I error (based on a 2-sample t test). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for each end point. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 54 [11] years), and 54 were excluded after randomization, leaving 346 patients. Among 341 patients with data available, 21 (6.2%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 18 (5.3%) were Black, 295 (86.5%) were White, and 7 (2.1%) were of other race; 33 of 330 patients with available data (10.0%) were of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Seventy-five of 346 patients (21.7%) had a first-degree relative with breast cancer. Patients who received quantitative counseling more accurately reported their CBC risk estimates than those who received standard counseling by univariate (coefficient, -9.39; 95% CI, -14.86 to -3.93; P < .001) and multivariate (coefficient, -9.52; 95% CI, -16.50 to -2.51; P = .008) analyses. The type of counseling did not significantly impact perception of risk, self-reported propensity to undergo CPM, or CPM rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, patients more accurately described their calculated CBC risk after quantitative counseling. This improved knowledge did not impact decisions to undergo CPM. The CBC risk assessment tool is publicly available and can be used for preoperative discussions.

A REtrospective Study to Describe the Real-World Treatment Landscape in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant PROstate Cancer: REMPRO.	INTRODUCTION: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) presents significant treatment challenges. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer for over 80 years, its efficacy is often limited to the initial treatment phase for most patients. Recent clinical trials have investigated various therapeutic options for mCRPC; however, real-world evidence is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the current treatment landscape and to identify unmet clinical needs. METHODS: A multi-country, retrospective, non-interventional study was conducted across 31 centres in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. Adults diagnosed with mCRPC between January 2016 and December 2018 were enrolled as the study subjects. Treatment patterns were thoroughly analysed, including those used when patients were at the metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) settings. RESULTS: Among 795 enrolled patients with mCRPC (most aged >/= 65 years), significant attrition was observed between treatment lines: approximately 50% of patients on first-line (1L) therapy advanced to second line (2L) but only 23.5% proceeded to third line (3L). New hormonal agent (NHA)-based therapies were the most prevalent choice for 1L and 2L, with post-chemotherapy NHA being the most common 1L-2L sequence. Disease progression, the primary reason for discontinuation across all regimens, occurred in > 60% of patients during mCRPC treatment. Generally, median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) decreased with each subsequent line of therapy. This study also highlights the inadequacy of prostate cancer screening in these regions. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insights into the current treatment landscape of patients with mCRPC in non-US and non-European settings within a real-world context. GOV ID: NCT04801186.

Survival Outcomes with Guideline-Concordant Pediatric-Inspired Regimens in Adolescent/Young Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Retrospective Real-World Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Pediatric-inspired regimens (PIR) yield excellent outcomes for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Despite national guidelines recommending PIR for adolescents and young adults (AYAs; aged 15-39 years), the use of guideline-concordant PIR in AYAs is inconsistent across treatment settings. METHODS: This retrospective observational study compared overall survival (OS) and stem cell transplant (SCT) use among AYAs treated with PIR versus non-PIR. Using a deidentified, geographically representative USA health claims database, we analyzed a cohort of AYAs with newly diagnosed ALL between 1 July 2007 and 30 September 2020. RESULTS: Among 599 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 187 (31%) received PIR, 303 (51%) received non-PIR, and for 109 (18%), treatment was undetermined. PIR and non-PIR groups were propensity score matched (n = 187 each). Using Kaplan-Meier methodology, OS was significantly higher for those treated with PIR versus non-PIR (log-rank P = 0.0001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.55). For PIR and non-PIR, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival estimates (95% CI) were 98.1% (95.3-99.3%) versus 88.3% (83.5-91.7%); 88.5% (82.6-92.5%) versus 69.1% (62.1-75.1%); and 87.3% (81.0-91.6%) versus 63.3% (55.2-70.3%). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were consistent with primary results. By Kaplan-Meier methodology, SCT use was significantly lower among AYAs treated with PIR than non-PIR (log-rank P = 0.0004; HR, 0.46; 95% CI 0.30-0.71); use by 2 years was 16.5% (12.2-22.2%) and 33.4% (27.6-40.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of guideline-concordant PIR for AYA ALL.

Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Molecular dysregulation, therapeutic advances, and future directions.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most common malignancies and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide. One of the main drivers is the dysregulation of the downstream signalling machinery. The PI3K, AKT, and mTOR signalling pathways play a pivotal role in cellular sustenance, growth, metabolism, and proliferation. In prostate cancer this pathway is generally altered due to the mutation or deletion of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene and unnecessary activities of some components of PI3K, AKT, or mTOR. Extracellular communication of the androgen receptor (AR) with a wide array of oncogenic signatures is a primary evasion mechanism of cancer therapy and metastasis. This review focuses on the structure and function of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to better understand its role in prostate tumor biology. Furthermore, current therapeutic strategies that combinatorically target individual components of this pathway, such as allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, first- and second-generation mTOR inhibitors, are under consideration. The study particularly focuses on the combined use of immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors), chemotherapy (docetaxel), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which are designed to break through the resistance-generating mechanisms and increase clinical efficacy. Overall, the findings support the need to conduct comprehensive preclinical and clinical studies on these alternative treatment regimens, and the eventual goal is to develop new treatment options for prostate cancer. The evidence of the pathway-specific therapy approach for the treatment of prostate cancer in recent clinical trials still failed to give a conclusive result. The current discussion also investigates the emerging areas of focus and perfection of combination regimens. The combination of all these developments makes it clear that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway is a key strategic point for developing therapeutics.

Current development and challenges of NK cell-based immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers.	Despite multimodal treatment options, most gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remain associated with high mortality rates and poor responsiveness to immunotherapy. The remarkable success of immune cell-based therapies in hematologic malignancies has raised interest in translating adoptive cell therapies to GI cancers. Among these approaches, natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies offer potent cytotoxicity, and a favorable safety profile. Multiple NK cell platforms are now under preclinical and clinical development, demonstrating encouraging therapeutic efficacy in GI malignancies. Nevertheless, challenges such as limited in vivo persistence, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and heterogeneous expression of NK cell therapy targeted antigens continue to limit therapeutic benefit. Recent advances are being explored to overcome these barriers and enhance NK cell persistence and specificity. This review summarizes recent progress in NK cell-based immunotherapy for GI cancers, highlights representative clinical trials, and discusses strategies to improve efficacy and durability. With continued innovation, NK cell-based therapy holds promise to become an essential component of the future immunotherapy landscape for GI malignancies.

Changing Perspectives in Managing Metastatic Gallbladder Cancer: Defining Oligometastatic Disease, Current Treatments, and Emerging Therapies.	BACKGROUND: Oligometastasisdisease (OMD) is an intermediate stage between localised disease and widespread metastasis. No standard OMD definition exists for gallbladder cancer (GBC). This review examines OMD definitions in GBC, treatment challenges, current strategies like systemic therapy, immunotherapy, surgery, loco-regional therapy, emerging approaches, and future directions for GBC patients with OMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review of GBC and oligometastasiswas conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar through July 2025. RESULTS: Metastatic GBC has a poor prognosis; however, a combination of systemic and immunotherapy can slightly improve survival, ranging from 11.3 to 12.7 months. OMD is a subgroup of patients (with 1-3 liver metastases, para-aortic lymph nodes, metastasis limited to adherent omentum, and/or up to three peritoneal deposits) who experience better survival with consolidative treatment, including neoadjuvant therapy followed by curative resection (such as minor hepatectomy, para-aortic lymphadenectomy) and adjuvant therapy. Reported survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years range from 20 to 64.0%, 5.7-17%, and 0-23%. Risk factors like extensive hepatic lobectomy and portal vein resection in cholestatic liver increase morbidity and mortality. Elevated preoperative tumour markers (CEA, CA 19 - 9) are associated with poorer survival. CONCLUSION: There is no standard definition of OMD in GBC. Our review emphasises the need to develop a standardised definition of OMD in GBC and for multidisciplinary evaluation and well-designed clinical trials to expand therapeutic options and to optimise patient outcomes.

Propofol attenuates angiogenesis by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress to suppress TFAP2C-driven VEGFA transcription.	During anesthesia, significant hemodynamic changes often alter the vascular microenvironment and affecting endothelial cell behavior. Propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic, has been widely studied for its role in tumor angiogenesis through tumor cell-derived VEGF-mediated endothelial interactions. However, its direct effects on endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis in non-malignant diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and coronary heart disease remain unclear. To address this gap, we examined the effects of propofol on VEGFA-mediated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, propofol triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting phosphorylation of PERK and its downstream effector eIF2alpha, leading to suppressed translation of TFAP2C-a transcription factor critical for endothelial function. Further analysis revealed that TFAP2C directly binds to the VEGFA promoter to activate its transcription, thereby facilitating VEGFA/VEGFR2-dependent angiogenesis. Together, these findings not only broaden the understanding of propofol's pharmacological profile, but also identify TFAP2C as a novel transcriptional regulator of VEGFA, offering new perspectives for therapeutic targeting of VEGFA-mediated angiogenesis.

AI-driven peptide discovery for endometrial cancer: deep generative modeling and molecular simulation in the big data era.	The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with molecular modeling offers new opportunities to accelerate therapeutic discovery. In this study, we developed an AI-driven generative pipeline combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to design novel peptide-like molecules targeting major proteins implicated in endometrial cancer (EC), including AKT1, ESR1, Connexin-43, and CTNNB1. From over 14,200 generated structures, approximately 2313 peptides met drug-likeness and structural criteria and were screened using deep learning-enhanced docking. Top-ranked peptides, such as Gitoxoside (- 11.53 kcal/mol) and 9-Fluoro-11 (- 11.38 kcal/mol), demonstrated stronger binding to AKT1 than the reference inhibitor Capivasertib (- 8.50 kcal/mol). Similar high-affinity interactions were observed for CTNNB1-SCHEMBL (- 12.33 kcal/mol) and ESR1-1Estra-1,3 (- 11.05 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of these complexes with RMSD values below 2.5 A and minimal residue fluctuations. WaterSwap free energy calculations yielded highly favorable binding energies (- 34 to - 37 kcal/mol), further validating stable ligand-protein interactions. ADMET predictions indicated acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and low predicted toxicity for most candidates. Collectively, this integrative AI framework efficiently explores peptide chemical space, enabling the rapid identification of peptide-based and peptidomimetic inhibitors with strong binding affinity and stability. The findings highlight the potential of AI-assisted peptide design as a scalable and cost-effective strategy for developing next-generation therapeutics against endometrial cancer.

[Influence of dysphagia and nutrition-dependent factors on the survival of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer : A retrospective cohort study].	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In addition to cancer-related survival, significant non-cancer-related modifiable risk factors are increasingly recognized in head and neck cancer due to disease localization and oncological therapy. Dysphagia in particular has an impact on overall survival, especially due to consequences such as aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. This study aimed to assess these risks and possible influencing factors in a typical patient population of a German head and neck cancer center. METHODS: Patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer were examined as part of a retrospective cohort study. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the influence of independent variables on dysphagia- and diet-dependent outcome variables. Factors influencing survival were identified using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Pretherapeutic underweight (hazard ratio, HR, 2.025) and pneumonia (HR 1.569) were identified as significant risk factors for survival in 214 patients. At the same time, pretherapeutic underweight was found to be an influencing factor for pretherapeutic dysphagia (OR 7.6), which, in turn, was an influencing factor for posttherapeutic dysphagia (odds ratio, OR, 12.1). The presence of pre- and posttherapeutic dysphagia had a significant influence (OR 4.0) on the development of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that early and consistent treatment of malnutrition and dysphagia could improve long-term survival. Further studies on interventions addressing these influencing and risk factors are necessary to extend the outcome evaluation of pretreatment, early, and inpatient rehabilitation measures after oncological therapy beyond solely subjective patient-centered outcome measures. These future investigations should also address the consequences of dysphagia on disease management, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality as well as the costs associated with its complications.

Long-term cabergoline use does not predict degree of prolactinoma fibrosis nor significantly impact surgical outcomes.	PURPOSE: Prolactinomas are often treated initially with dopamine agonists (DA). For patients subsequently treated with surgery, the effect of cabergoline (CAB) on tumor fibrosis and its potential impact on surgical outcomes is largely unexplored. METHODS: Records of patients with prolactinoma treated by a single surgeon between 2006 and 2024 were examined. Analyses considered relationships among duration and cumulative dose of presurgical DA (DA + vs. DA-), extent of fibrosis measured quantitatively by collagen volume fraction (CVF) and qualitatively by surgeon assessment, and remission status at last follow-up. RESULTS: Of 59 patients, 22 were DA- and 37 were DA+, including 29 treated only with CAB and 8 treated with CAB and bromocriptine. There were 44 macroadenomas, 13 microadenomas, and 2 giant adenomas; 28 had cavernous sinus invasion (Knosp grade 3-4) 52.5% were in remission at last follow-up. Median cumulative CAB dose was 79.3 mg (range, 5.4-6711), used for a median duration of 570 days (range, 16-7830). Neither CAB dose nor duration correlated with CVF (r(2) < 0.01, p = NS). Both surgeon fibrosis assessment and CVF were higher in DA + patients, but neither independently predicted remission. Cumulative CAB dose and duration also did not predict remission. On univariable analysis, cavernous sinus invasion (OR 10.3, p < 0.001) and tumor size (OR 6.6, p = 0.02) predicted remission, but in multivariable analysis no single factor remained significant. CONCLUSION: Duration and cumulative dose of presurgical CAB use do not correlate with quantitative measures of tumor fibrosis and do not reliably predict the degree of fibrosis at surgery or the likelihood of surgical remission.

CSN5 overexpression promotes the integral progression of cervical cancer by enhancing ENO3-mediated glycolysis.	Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health challenge. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving CC progression is crucial for developing improved therapeutic strategies. CSN5 is vital in cell functions and cancer, but its role in CC is unclear. This study aims to explore CSN5's role and its target gene in CC progression, assessing their potential as therapeutic targets. We employed an integrated approach combining bioinformatics analysis, proteomic profiling, and in vitro and in vivo functional assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze CSN5 and ENO3 expression in CC and normal tissues. CSN5 upregulation was associated with advanced clinical stage and poor differentiation. Furthermore, CSN5 overexpression enhanced cellular proliferation and glycolytic metabolism but, paradoxically, suppressed migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These pro-tumorigenic effects were confirmed in vivo, and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG was found to reverse the phenotypes induced by CSN5. Protein sequencing highlighted ENO3's role in CSN5-mediated tumorigenesis, regulating EMT and glycolysis by stabilizing its ubiquitination degradation through CSN5. Crucially, silencing ENO3 attenuated the oncogenic effects of CSN5 both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings unveil a novel mechanistic paradigm in which CSN5 promotes CC progression by co-opting ENO3 to enhance glycolytic flux while concurrently suppressing cell motility. This study not only deepens the understanding of CC pathogenesis but also identifies the CSN5-ENO3 axis as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions.

The dual fate of DYRK2 in cancer: balancing the light and dark side of tumorigenesis.	Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) is emerging as a pivotal player in cancer biology due to its pleiotropic cellular roles, functioning either as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in a tissue- and genotype-dependent manner. DYRK2 regulates critical processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and stress signaling. As a tumor suppressor, DYRK2 facilitates the degradation of oncogenic proteins (e.g., c-Myc, SNAIL, TERT) and enhances apoptosis via p53 activation. Loss of DYRK2 has been associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in cancers such as colorectal, breast, and liver. Conversely, DYRK2 overexpression in certain tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian carcinoma, supports oncogenic roles by enhancing proteasome function, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and contributing to therapy resistance. This functional dichotomy is modulated by post-translational modifications, microenvironmental stress, epigenetic regulation, subcellular localization, and interaction with protein complexes, underscoring the complexity of DYRK2 regulation. Therapeutically, DYRK2 represents a promising but context-sensitive target, with inhibitors showing efficacy in preclinical models of proteasome-addicted cancers, although precise biomarkers and cancer subtype stratification remain critical. Future directions include refining in vivo models and delineating the role of DYRK2 in cancer stem cell dynamics and immune modulation, emphasizing that understanding its context-dependent activity is essential to exploit its full therapeutic potential in oncology.

Clinicopathological characteristics, incidence trends, and prognostic factors of salivary gland secretory carcinoma: a SEER database analysis (2011-2021).	PURPOSE: This study aimed to comprehensively analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SGSC) using a large population-based cohort to determine temporal patterns, identify independent survival predictors, and evaluate treatment effectiveness for optimizing clinical management. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with SGSC between 2011 and 2021 were included. We analyzed clinicopathological features, incidence trends, and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 36.5 months, the overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.93% and 86.53%, respectively. The incidence of SGSC has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of 6.3 cases per year in 2011-2013 to 29.3 cases per year in 2019-2021. This increase was predominantly driven by early-stage (I/II) tumors (75.9%), with the parotid gland being the most common primary site. Multivariable analysis identified age > 55 years and AJCC Stage IV disease as independent poor prognostic factors. Surgical intervention, including local tumor excision and glandectomy, was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Notably, patients who received a combination of surgery and radiotherapy had better outcomes compared to those who received either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study with extended follow-up clarifies the rising incidence and early-stage predominance of SGSC. Age, TNM stage, and surgical treatment were identified as key prognostic factors.

Ultra-Sensitive and direct detection of MiRNAs in real samples via duplex-specific nuclease-mediated signal amplification.	The expression levels of miRNAs in cells or biological fluids are closely associated with the onset and progression of many diseases, making the detection of miRNAs in serum and plasma increasingly important. However, due to the low levels of miRNAs in biological fluids and the complexity of their surrounding environment, their analysis faces challenges related to accuracy and reproducibility. We developed a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-mediated detection method for the direct detection of miRNA-21 in real samples. This method eliminates the need for total RNA extraction from real samples using commercial kits, a key advantage over traditional methods requiring pre-treatment. As verified by performance evaluation, this method exhibits a linear range of 5.00 fmol.L(- 1) to 500 pmol.L(- 1) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.66 fmol.L(- 1) for miRNA-21. Direct detection of miRNA-21 in real samples yielded favorable results. These findings confirm that the method holds great application potential for the direct detection of miRNA-21 in real biological samples and exhibits promising prospects in clinical cancer diagnosis and drug screening.

Predictive value of the Cancer and Aging Research Group Score for chemotherapy toxicities in older adults with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate whether the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) score is suitable for assessing chemotherapy toxicity risk in older adults with cancer. METHODS: Studies that enrolled older cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and compared incidence of chemotherapy toxicity in three CARG score categories- low CARG (0-5), intermediate CARG (6-9), and high CARG (10-23), were identified using PubMed and EMBASE, as well as screening the references of reviewed studies. Studies that performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and reported area under curve (AUC) were also included. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the risk ratio (RR) of >/= grade 3 toxicity and integrate AUC. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies published between 2019 and 2025 were included in our analysis with a total of 4,140 older patients who underwent various types of chemotherapy. Nineteen studies reported categorical results and 14 studies reported AUC. Higher CARG category patients had a significantly higher incidence of >/= grade 3 chemotherapy toxicity than lower CARG category patients (Intermediate CARG vs. low CARG; RR [95% CI]: 1.26 [1.07-1.48], p = 0.006, I(2) = 74%. High CARG vs. intermediate CARG; RR [95% CI]: 1.30 [1.15-1.46], p < 0.001, I(2) = 67%. High CARG vs. low CARG; RR [95% CI]: 1.68 [1.32-2.15], p < 0.001, I(2) = 86%.). Integrated AUC was 0.633 (95% CI: 0.558-0.709). CONCLUSIONS: The CARG score is an effective tool for assessing the risk of >/= grade 3 chemotherapy toxicity in older adults as part of geriatric assessment.

Roy adaptation model-based patient education for elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the Roy adaptation model (RAM)-based patient education on adaptation levels to the disease, mental health, and life satisfaction of elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. METHODS: The study adapted a pretest-posttest randomized clinical trial design with a comparison between the RAM group (giving RAM-based patient education plus usual care; n = 80) and the usual care group (giving usual care pathways; n = 80). The primary outcome measure was physiologic-physical, self-concept, role function, and interdependence adaption levels measured by the subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gastric Module (FACT-Ga). Secondary outcome measures were mental health measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and life satisfaction by the Life Satisfaction Index A (LSI-A). RESULTS: The RAM group showed shortened time to flatus and first oral intake, and reduced postoperative hospitalization compared to the usual care group (p < 0.05). The analysis of covariance controlling for baseline scores suggested that a significantly main effect of treatment in patient's scores in each FACT-G subscale, FACT-G total, gastric cancer subscale, and FACT-Ga total, HADS-A, HADS-D, and LSI-A. The RAM group had higher scores of physical well-being (eta(2) = 0.10), emotional well-being (eta(2) = 0.12), functional well-being (eta(2) = 0.11), and social well-being (eta(2) = 0.06) subscales of FACT-Ga, FACT-G total (eta(2) = 0.30), gastric cancer subscale (eta(2) = 0.10), and FACT-Ga total (eta(2) = 0.28), lower scores of HADS-A (eta(2) = 0.12) and HADS-D (eta(2) = 0.11), and a higher score of LSI-A (eta(2) = 0.12) than the usual care group at 1 month post intervention. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that RAM-based patient education could effectively increase adaptation levels to the disease, improve mental health, and life satisfaction of elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.

ViMDT: a clinical data visual analysis tool for multi-disciplinary treatment of lung cancer.	Multi-disciplinary treatment (MDT) has become a routine practice in clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, playing an indispensable role in clinical decision-making. By integrating expertise from multiple disciplines, MDT provides patients with individualized diagnosis and treatment strategies. However, there is not yet a specialized clinical data visualization tool for MDT. This paper develops a novel clinical data analysis visualization tool for MDT, which analyzes in-depth and displays patient data comprehensively. Specifically, this tool designs a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based visualization model for clinical unstructured data, and Z-Score-3sigma transformation and hierarchical strategies for clinical structural data. Moreover, we propose to predict personalized anti-tumor drug efficacy based on topic keywords. The results showed that, compared with users who did not use the tool, the time cost in MDT decision-making for users who used the tool was reduced by 26.17%. Furthermore, the proposed drug efficacy prediction method achieved an accuracy rate of 71.08% on a dataset of 958 patients with non-small cell cancer treated with anti-tumor drugs. The proposed tool is potentially helpful for doctors in MDT tasks by vividly visualizing the large-scale complex clinical data and improving the MDT efficiency.

Model-Based Alternative Dosing Strategies for Subcutaneous Nivolumab to Improve Cost Effectiveness.	BACKGROUND: The increasing use of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab places a significant financial burden on healthcare systems, contributes to environmental concerns, and strains hospital capacities. The nivolumab average exposure and exposure variation of a fixed subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen (1200 mg every 4 weeks) is significantly higher compared with 3-mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenous dosing. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop alternative dosing regimens for SC nivolumab to reduce drug expenses and lower the treatment burden for patients while ensuring effective exposure. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic simulation was conducted using a population pharmacokinetic model developed by the license holder to explore alternative SC regimens. In this process, patients were divided into three weight groups: less than 60 kg, 60-90 kg, and more than 90 kg. Furthermore, two experimental progressive alternative dosing regimens were developed, one based on a minimum effective concentration-driven approach. The second progressive alternative regimen was based on using the 1200-mg SC formulation as an intravenous infusion. RESULTS: We developed an alternative bodyweight-based regimen consisting of SC 1200 mg every 7 weeks (<60 kg), 1200 mg every 6 weeks (60-90 kg), and 1200 mg every 5 weeks (>90 kg). This new alternative dosing regimen would save an average of euro24,345 (35%) per patient per year compared with SC 1200 mg every 4 weeks. The results for the first experimental, progressive, extended-interval dosing regimen for patients with melanoma indicate that 95% of patients exceed a steady-state trough concentration of 2.5 mg/L when administered SC 1200 mg every 10 weeks. This dosing regimen would decrease the yearly cost from euro68,870 to euro27,548 (60% less) per patient per year. The second experimental progressive regimen using SC 1200 mg as an intravenous administration every 7 weeks leads to a potential saving of euro29,516, which is a 43% decrease compared with the SC 1200-mg approved regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The developed dosing regimen with a bodyweight-dependent interval offers a cost-effective and patient-friendly method to optimize SC nivolumab use while ensuring adequate exposure, which can be directly implemented in clinical practice. Moreover, the two experimental progressive proposed regimens provide a rationale for a clinical non-inferiority study in which alternative dose regimens are compared to standard dosing according to the drug label.

Quality of cancer-related data from the Danish National patient registry (1994-2025) and the Danish cancer registry (2004-2025): a systematic review.	The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) and the Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) are central to registry-based cancer research. This systematic review evaluates studies assessing the quality of cancer-related data in these registries under their current data structures. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched on January 24, 2025 (PROSPERO: CRD420251005952). Studies validating cancer-related data in the DNPR or DCR against a gold standard were included. Findings were synthesized narratively and categorized by DNPR data, DCR data, or multi-source algorithms. The literature search generated 915 records, of which 50 were included: 23 validated DNPR data, 9 DCR data, and 18 algorithm performance. The quality of DNPR cancer diagnoses and treatment showed positive predictive values (PPVs) of 57-100%, highest for common malignancies and treatments. The quality of DNPR comorbidities and complications varied substantially (PPVs 0-98%). The PPV of a melanoma diagnosis in the DCR was 97%. The DCR staging completeness varied considerably (34-95%). Algorithms presented PPVs of 60-96% for recurrence, active cancer, and recognized metastases, and 28% for unrecognized metastases. The DNPR and DCR provide high-quality data for many cancer diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, supporting their use in register-based research. While some data elements, including data on complications, exhibit lower quality, algorithmic approaches can enhance utility for less robust data. However, several aspects of cancer-related data remain unvalidated.	European journal of epidemiology	2026 Jan 12	['Simoni AH', 'Hald K', 'Overvad TF', 'Sogaard M', 'Ording AG']	41524884
An extension of the validation cohort of the Dutch Early-Stage Melanoma (D-ESMEL) study for stage-specific analyses.	There is a high need for accurate prognostic models among stage II melanoma to determine who may benefit from (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy. The Dutch Early- Stage Melanoma (D-ESMEL) study was designed to identify new prognostic features in a population-based sample of stage I/II melanoma patients in addition to American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) staging. The validation cohort of the D-ESMEL study employs a nested case-control design. Initially, controls were randomly sampled to develop prognostic that included both known and new prognostic factors to assess the additive value of new prognostic factors. As a consequence, most controls had a very thin melanoma (<1.0 mm) while most cases had a thicker melanoma (>2.0 mm). This resulted in insufficient variability and high weights for stage II controls when applying weighted analyses in absolute risk prediction models. Therefore, randomly sampled controls were re-matched on AJCC stage (stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIC), and new stage-matched controls were collected for cases who could not be rematched. The original D-ESMEL validation cohort included 5,815 stage I/II melanoma patients, of whom 154 developed distant metastasis (cases). 98/154 Cases were stage II and only 24 stage II controls were included, while the stage-matched design now includes 153 stage-matched case-control sets of which 97 stage II cases and 97 stage II controls derived from a population-based cohort of 5,785 stage I/II patients. The updated design increased the biological variability among stage II controls, balanced weights in weighted analyses and thereby facilitating reliable subgroup analyses in this clinically important subgroup.

Alcohol Use Disorder versus Adverse In-Hospital Outcomes after Radical Cystectomy and Ileal Conduit Urinary Diversion.	BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BCa). Alcohol use disorder (AUD) may predispose to worse adverse in-hospital outcomes after RC and ileal conduit urinary diversion. The current study addressed this knowledge gap. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Descriptive analyses, propensity score matching (PSM), and multivariable logistic and Poisson regression models were used to address patients with BCa treated with RC and ileal conduit within National Inpatient Sample (2006-2019). RESULTS: Of 15,018 RC and ileal conduit patients, 320 (2.1%) had history of AUD at baseline. Compared with their non-AUD counterparts, patients with AUD exhibited significantly higher rates of adverse in-hospital outcomes in 9 of 14 categories, namely: critical care therapies (Delta + 12.0%), overall complications (Delta + 11.0%), prolonged length of stay (Delta + 11.0%), pulmonary complications (Delta + 6.0%), acute kidney injury (Delta + 5.0%), hepatic complications (Delta + 3.2%), in-hospital mortality (Delta + 2.8%), cardiac complications (Delta + 1.6%), and total hospital charges (Delta + 7925 US$, all p < 0.05). After multivariable adjustment, AUD independently predicted higher rates of adverse in-hospital outcomes in the same 9 of 15 categories, namely: hepatic complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.3], in-hospital mortality (OR 3.2), acute kidney injury (OR 1.7), overall complications (OR 1.7), cardiac complications (OR 1.5), critical care therapies (OR 1.4), prolonged length of stay (OR 1.3), pulmonary complications (OR 1.2), and total hospital charges (OR 1.2, all p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Since AUD significantly predisposes to higher rates of adverse in-hospital outcomes and in-hospital mortality after RC and ileal conduit urinary diversion, precautionary measures prior to admission and during hospital stay may be warranted in patients with AUD.

A Longitudinal Study on Development and Validation of the Prostate Cancer Scale Among the System of Quality of Life Instruments for Patients with Cancer (QLICP-PR V2.0) Based on Classical Test Theory and Generalizability Theory.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the prostate cancer scale among the system of quality-of-life instruments for patients with cancer (QLICP-PR V2.0) to provide a reliable tool for assessing quality of life changes and clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Application of programmed decision procedures, including multiple qualitative and quantitative analyses with general module and specific module combination pattern, were utilized to develop the QLICP-PR V2.0. On the basis of the data from 115 admitted and discharged patients with prostate cancer, the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the QLICP-PR V2.0 scale were evaluated using correlation analysis, multi-trait scaling analysis, factor analysis, structural equation model, and paired t-tests, as well as combined with generalizability theory. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha, test-retest reliability, and intra-class correlation coefficient of the total scale were 0.886, 0.896, and 0.889, respectively. Correlation analysis and factor analysis confirmed good construct validity and criterion-related validity. The score differences at all five domains and the total scale before and after the treatment were statistically significant (P < 0.05), with the SRM value ranging from - 1.152 to - 0.408, and the total scale was - 1.152. Generalizability theory results showed that the generalization coefficient of the five domains of the scale range from 0.575 to 0.764, and the reliability index between 0.529 and 0.748. CONCLUSIONS: The QLICP-PR V2.0 has good psychometric properties in reliability, validity, and responsiveness, and can be used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer.

Relationship Between the Oral Microbiome and Treatment Efficacy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: As the relationship between oral microbiota and treatment efficacy in esophageal cancer remains unexplored, we aimed to clarify it using metagenomic analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 140 consecutive patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent esophagectomy with R0 resection at Hiroshima University Hospital between April 2020 and May 2024, 74 who received neoadjuvant therapy were included in this study. 16S rRNA gene from oral tongue coating samples was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and subjected to next-generation sequencing. The oral microbiome data were analyzed using QIIME2 and linear discriminant analysis effect size, and the relationship between the oral microbiota and treatment efficacy and prognosis was assessed. RESULTS: Alpha diversity of the oral microbiota was significantly correlated with the pathological response. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the alpha diversity of the oral microbiome (high versus low) was a significant predictor of a good pathological response. Patients with high alpha diversity had significantly improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival compared with those with low alpha diversity. Furthermore, eight bacterial groups (Lactobacillales, Peptostreptococcales-Tissierellales, Bifidobacteriaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Anaerovoracaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Aerococcaceae) were significantly more abundant in individuals who responded well to neoadjuvant therapy and two bacterial groups (Streptococcaceae and Corynebacteriaceae) were significantly more abundant in poor responders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a correlation between the oral microbiome and ESCC treatment efficacy, suggesting that it is a significant prognostic factor. Our findings may also help predict the efficacy of esophageal cancer treatment.

True Incidence of Appendiceal Neoplasms in Patients Presenting with Complicated Appendicitis: A Call for a Revised Management Algorithm.	BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest an association between complicated appendicitis and underlying appendiceal neoplasms, but the reported incidence varies widely. This study aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of appendiceal neoplasms among patients with radiographically diagnosed complicated appendicitis. METHODS: This study analyzed adult patients with radiologic diagnoses of complicated appendicitis (perforation, abscess, phlegmon, gangrene, or mucocele) at a tertiary center (2010-2024). To ensure diagnostic accuracy, an expert surgeon reviewed radiologic images with uncertain findings. The appendiceal neoplasm rate was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression identified preoperative predictors of neoplasm. RESULTS: Among 1690 patients with acute appendicitis, 387 (23 %) had a diagnosis of complicated appendicitis. Of these patients, 304 (78.6 %) underwent surgical treatment, whereas 56 (14.5 %) were managed nonoperatively. The rate of appendiceal neoplasms among patients with complicated appendicitis was 16.1 %. The most common tumor type was mucinous neoplasm (54 %), followed by neuroendocrine tumor (19 %) and adenocarcinoma (13 %). The incidence of appendiceal neoplasms varied significantly based on radiologic findings, with the highest rate observed in cases with mucocele (58 %), followed by abscess (18 %), phlegmon (16 %), and perforated appendicitis (12 %). After adjustment for confounders, older patient age, larger appendiceal diameter, lymphadenopathy, peritoneal enhancement, and absence of fat-stranding were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of neoplasm. CONCLUSION: Appendiceal neoplasms were identified in 16.1 % of patients presenting with complicated appendicitis, representing a notably high incidence in this population. In the context of growing nonoperative management, radiologic and clinical predictors may need to be considered to guide decisions regarding surgery and follow-up evaluation.

An integrated microfluidic culture model for photodynamic therapy evaluations under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved cancer treatment that combines photosensitizer, oxygen, and light to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its efficacy is often compromised by restricted drug and light penetration, and hypoxic microenvironments in solid tumors, making it essential to establish in vitro models that can recapitulate these features for PDT studies and treatment optimization. In this work, we present a microfluidic platform incorporating an agarose gel-embedded tumor cell culture that enables precise geometric and environmental control, including defined microchamber architecture, dynamic perfusion-based photosensitizer delivery, oxygen regulation, and tunable light exposure for systematic PDT efficacy evaluation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) simulations guided the optimization of loading agarose-cell suspensions into confined microchambers. The hexagonal microchamber layout and hydrogel matrix supported cell positioning within controlled diffusion domains. A modular dye-based optical filter system generated spatially tunable light fluence, while integrated gas control regulated normoxic and hypoxic conditions. PDT studies revealed that dynamic perfusion and microenvironmental constraints produced a spatial gradient of treatment response along the flow direction of photosensitizer. ROS generation was markedly higher under normoxia than hypoxia, and live/dead and CCK-8 assays confirmed a light dose-dependent decline in viability under normoxia, whereas hypoxic cultures maintained > 85% viability. Collectively, by capturing key tumor microenvironmental features such as diffusion limitations and oxygen deprivation, this platform offers a useful tool for photosensitizer assessment, PDT protocol optimization, and mechanistic investigation of oxygen-dependent PDT responses.

Epigenetic Inhibition of HDAC7 by Daidzein isolated from Macrotyloma uniflorum: A potential therapeutic approach in leukemia in silico, in-vitro and in-vivo.	Leukaemia remains a critical haematologic malignancy, where current therapies offer limited efficacy and are frequently associated with significant toxicity. Epigenetic dysregulation, particularly aberrant histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, promotes uncontrolled proliferation and suppression of apoptosis in leukaemic cells, with HDAC7 identified as a central driver of disease progression. Daidzein, a natural isoflavonoid from Macrotyloma uniflorum, represents a promising plant-derived HDAC inhibitor. This study evaluated daidzein's anti-leukaemic potential using integrated computational, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed stable HDAC7 binding with a binding affinity of -7.6 kcalmol(-)(1), comparable to vorinostat (SAHA; -6.7 kcalmol(-)(1)). Daidzein significantly inhibited HL-60 cell viability (IC(5)(0) = 19.6 microM) and HDAC activity (IC(5)(0) = 3.4 microM), induced apoptosis and G(0)/G(1) arrest, and modulated key epigenetic markers by downregulating HDAC7 and enhancing H3K27 acetylation. In vivo, daidzein markedly reduced blast cell burden in blood and bone marrow and alleviated leukaemia-associated hepatic and splenic pathology. HDAC7 suppression was further verified by immunohistochemistry in spleen and liver tissues. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cell profiling showed enhancement of T cells and myeloid cells with concurrent reductions in B cells and macrophages, suggesting immunomodulatory potential.The demonstrated anti-leukaemic and immunomodulatory effects support further investigation toward potential clinical use.

The role of glycoproteins in autophagy and apoptosis in colorectal cancer: A scoping review.	"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadliest cancers worldwide. Despite current treatments, therapeutic resistance remains a paramount challenge. Glycoproteins play essential roles in cellular processes and have been linked to drug resistance in CRC. This scoping review aims to synthesise the existing evidence on the role of glycoproteins in regulating apoptosis and autophagy in colorectal cancer. A comprehensive search was conducted using the keywords (""Autophagy"") AND (""Apoptosis "") AND (""glycoprotein"" OR ""glycosylated proteins"") AND (""colorectal cancer"" OR ""colon cancer"" OR ""CRC"") across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on 1 May 2025 without restriction. A total of nine English-language original articles were included. The outcomes show that glycoproteins such as P-gp and MRP-1 are often overexpressed in CRC cells. Inhibition of these glycoproteins significantly reduces their expression and the proliferation of CRC cells, while also enhancing cell death via apoptosis and autophagy. Hence, regulating glycoproteins in CRC provides a novel strategy to inhibit cancer progression, offering a potential avenue to overcoming therapy resistance in CRC. However, further in vivo research is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of action of glycoproteins."

SFG enhances apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting tunneling nanotubes-mediated mitochondrial transport in the tumor microenvironment.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, is characterized by a rising incidence and an alarmingly low rate of early diagnosis, presenting a significant global public health challenge. The development of safe and effective therapeutic agents for HCC is therefore a pressing necessity. Sophoraflavanone G (SFG), a bioactive flavonoid derived from Sophora flavescens Ait., has exhibited potent antitumor activity. However, its specific efficacy against HCC and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. In vitro studies have demonstrated that SFG suppresses HCC cell proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and activates intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Consistent with these results, in vivo experiments utilizing a HepG2 xenograft model confirmed that SFG, administered at doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg/kg, effectively inhibits tumor growth without causing observable toxicity. These findings further support the activation of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in response to SFG treatment. Importantly, SFG was also found to interfere with the unidirectional mitochondrial transfer mediated by tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and HCC cells. This disruption attenuated the pro-survival influence of the tumor microenvironment and enhanced apoptosis in HCC cells. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that SFG exerts potent anti-HCC effects through dual mechanisms: direct induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and indirect disruption of TNT-mediated stromal support. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of SFG as a promising candidate for the treatment of HCC.

Phyllanthus niruri potentiates apoptosis in Huh-7 cells and mitigates diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via Hippo-YAP pathway modulation.	Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the deadliest cancers occurring worldwide. Substantial evidence suggests that the Hippo-YAP pathway as a promising therapeutic target. Phyllanthus niruri is known for pharmacological activities, including hepatoprotective, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is a lacuna of molecular studies on how the bioactives in Phyllanthus niruri interacts with hippo signaling to enhance its potential for liver cancer management. This study aimed to delineate the effects of Phyllanthus niruri extract on cell proliferation and apoptosis, and its mechanisms in modulating the Hippo-YAP signaling, using Huh-7 cells and a diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer model in Wistar rats. MTT assay results confirmed that Phyllanthus niruri reduced the viability of Huh-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, Phyllanthus niruri extracts decreased nuclear YAP-localization by modulating upstream regulators of the Hippo-YAP pathway and promoted apoptosis, as evidenced by increased ROS levels and the upregulation of Bax and downregulation Bcl-2 protein expression. In diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer rats, oral administration of Phyllanthus niruri extract significantly reduced tumor burden, activated hippo signaling, and exhibited therapeutic effects. Overall, Phyllanthus niruri extracts exhibited anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic effects in experimental liver cancer models offering valuable insights into their mechanism of action through modulation of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

Progenitor CD8(+) T cells and hyper-Treg crosstalk: a driver of immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Despite the crucial role of antigen presentation in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy, its contribution and the mechanism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear, representing a key knowledge gap in overcoming immune escape in its immunotherapy. This study explores how tumor antigen presentation and intercellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive ICI resistance using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Publicly available scRNA-seq data from 24 ESCC patients treated with chemotherapy and ICIs were analyzed. Cell clustering, transcription factor regulation, cell-cell communication analysis, and KEGG/GO enrichment analyses were used to examine malignant cell heterogeneity, the relationship between antigen-presenting cells and ICI responses, and cell-cell interactions influencing anti-tumor response. Spatial relationships were validated through multiplex immunofluorescence. Malignant cells were classified by enrichment analyses into cNMF_1, cNMF_2, cNMF_3, and cNMF_4, with cNMF_4 showing antigen-presenting traits. Based on ICI response groups, cell-cell communication analysis revealed that in poor responders, the antigen presentation ability of tumors induced by treatment was enhanced, and mainly enriched in the MHC-I pathway. The crosstalk between Progenitor CD8(+) Tex and hyper-Treg in the TME drove ICI resistance. Hyper-Treg likely regulated CD8(+) T activation through the CLEC2C-KLRB1 axis, forming an inhibitory cell interaction network dominated by hyper-Treg, resulting in an overall strong immune suppression state of the TME in this population. The antigen-presenting malignant epithelial cells of ESCC exhibit significant interactions with various T cells in the TME. ICI resistance is closely associated with the crosstalk between progenitor CD8(+) Tex and hyper-Treg, representing a promising target for personalized ESCC therapy.

Non-metastatic breast cancer patients discontinuing aromatase inhibitor on denosumab: what next?	"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are one of the adjuvant endocrine therapies of choice, for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women and premenopausal women with ovarian suppression. However, treatment with AIs leads to accelerated bone loss, and an increased fracture risk. Denosumab or bisphosphonates are recommended to prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk during AIs treatment. However, specific attention must be paid to the ""rebound phenomenon"" after denosumab discontinuation. This review focuses on the therapeutic benefits of denosumab for its antiresorptive and antifracture effect in women with early breast cancer treated with AIs, risks related to denosumab discontinuation after treatment with AIs, prevention, and potential interventions for its associated fracture risk. A narrative review of available literature was carried out by International Osteoporosis Foundation Committee of Scientific Advisors Working Group on Cancer-Induced Bone Disease. Papers were retrieved by means of a PubMed enquiry (from 2006 to August 2025). A total of 126 papers closely related to our topic were included. After denosumab withdrawal in women with breast cancer treated with AIs, bone turnover increases, and there is a risk of spontaneous rebound-associated vertebral fractures, even in the absence of other risk factors for bone fragility. Therefore, expert consensus suggests initiating bisphosphonate treatment after denosumab discontinuation, even though there is no an optimal bisphosphonate regimen. There are numerous open research questions which future prospective studies will have to answer in order to personalize the most appropriate antiresorptive therapy for each patient."

Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress in oesophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma: a potential therapeutic strategy.	Advanced oesophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (ENEC) is a highly aggressive and rare malignancy with poor prognosis. Due to the rarity of this cancer there are currently no standardised treatment regimens for ENEC, and models to study this disease are difficult to obtain. To address this, we screened our established circulating tumour cell line from a patient with metastatic ENEC, termed UWG01CTC, using the LOPAC((R))(1280) drug repurposing library. The redox modulatory agent adaphostin was identified as a potent cytotoxin against UWG01CTC but not non-ENEC cell lines. Secondary adaphostin cell viability screens returned IC(50) values of 0.201 +/- 0.024 microM confirming the high sensitivity of this ENEC CTC line to the drug. Inclusion of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine significantly protected the UWG01CTCs against the cytotoxic effects of adaphostin (IC(50) = 0.928 +/- 0.425 microM), corroborating a mechanism mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The expression of DNA damage marker phospho-gammaH2AX and apoptotic marker cleaved PARP1 were both elevated in cells treated with adaphostin, suggesting that the increased intracellular ROS levels induced by the drug causes downstream DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis. Thus, adaphostin shows promise as a potential new and selective treatment for ENEC.

Structure-based drug design of small-molecule c-Myc G-quadruplex binders.	"The c-Myc oncogene is crucial in tumorigenesis. Although it is a promising therapeutic target, its protein lacks a conventional drug-binding pocket, making it traditionally ""undruggable"". Recent studies show that the c-Myc promoter can form a G-quadruplex (G4) structure, which suppresses transcription and offers a new strategy for indirect inhibition. In this study, structure-based virtual screening was performed using the c-Myc G4 crystal structure to screen the ChemDiv compound library, aiming to identify small molecules that bind to the G4 structure. Candidate compounds were evaluated in preliminary in vitro assays for biological activity. The results showed that Y502-3888 binds to the c-Myc G4 and downregulates c-Myc expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these findings support the potential of Y502-3888 as a c-Myc G4 binder for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), providing a foundation for future development of anticancer agents targeting the c-Myc G4."

Screening of metabolic markers related to molecular typing of breast cancer based on 1H NMR metabonomics.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease classified into 4 molecular subtypes, each with distinct molecular characteristics that influence treatment strategies, clinical outcomes and prognosis. These subtypes are associated with specific changes in cellular metabolism, which may play a crucial role in tumor development and progression. OBJECTIVES: To identify distinctive serum metabolic biomarkers for each molecular BC subtype and to evaluate their associations with estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status, thereby refining molecular classification and informing personalized treatment strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study utilized the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) metabolomics method to collect serum metabolic profiles from BC patients. Pattern recognition analysis was employed to analyze the metabolic data. Metabolic markers specific to each molecular subtype were selected, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was employed to explore serum metabolic pathway heterogeneity. RESULTS: Distinct metabolic markers were identified for each molecular subtype, demonstrating strong discriminatory power. Additionally, we identified specific serum metabolites whose levels correlate with ER and HER2 expression profiles. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in serum metabolic pathways across different subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates pronounced metabolic differences across BC subtypes that mirror their distinct molecular profiles and may underlie variations in therapeutic response. These metabolomic insights hold promise for refining tumor classification, improving diagnostic accuracy and guiding more personalized treatment strategies.

Integrative Clinical and Molecular Evaluation of Renal Cell Carcinoma with Merlin Protein Deficiency and Biallelic Loss of NF2.	PURPOSE: In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoding the merlin protein is associated with aggressive clinical behavior. However, data regarding the clinical course and additional molecular features in the context of contemporary systemic therapies remains limited. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were evaluated in patients with RCC exhibiting merlin loss by immunohistochemistry in one academic cohort. Integrative genomic analyses were performed, including targeted DNA sequencing via the institutional OncoPanel assay and RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: In the institutional cohort (n=33), most patients had biphasic hyalinizing psammomatous RCC (66.6%) and metastatic disease (78.8%). Among 23 patients receiving systemic therapy, those treated with non-immunotherapy (IO)-based regimens (n=5) had numerically longer overall survival (24.5 vs 16.5 months, p=0.2) and progression-free survival (9.8 vs 5 months, p=0.5) compared to IO-based therapies (n=18), though differences were not statistically significant. Genomic analysis (n=17) revealed frequent truncating mutations of NF2 (82.3%) and recurrent alterations in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage-response signaling genes with prominent deletions in tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A/B. Transcriptomic profiling of NF2-inactivated tumors from TCGA (n=13) demonstrated enrichment of cellular proliferation and concurrent suppression of metabolic and immune pathways, suggesting an aggressive phenotype compared to clear cell RCC without NF2 inactivation (n=529). CONCLUSIONS: Biallelic NF2 inactivation and merlin protein deficiency drives an aggressive RCC phenotype marked by immune dysfunction, high proliferation, and frequent cell cycle and DNA damage-response signaling alterations. Limited treatment response to immunotherapy highlights the need for molecularly tailored therapies.

Interdigitating Dendritic Cell Sarcoma: A Rare Diagnostic Challenge.	Interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma (IDCS) is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis, and currently, there lacks a standardized treatment protocol. IDCS can be challenging diagnostically given its immunophenotypic overlap with other malignancies such as melanoma. We describe a 52-year-old woman presenting with a left cervical mass. Following workup and MDT discussion, she underwent a unilateral modified radical neck dissection and superficial parotidectomy. On histopathological examination, despite some morphological and immunohistochemical overlap with melanoma, IDCS was confidently diagnosed. There have been few cases of IDCS in the head and neck published since the most recent pooled analysis. This case adds to the current literature, highlights unique diagnostic findings, and explores its overlap with melanoma. More data are required regarding treatment outcomes and follow-up for cases of IDCS. Increased reporting such as this case will facilitate future analyses to guide management of this rare malignancy.

Lung Cancer in Patients With COPD: Predictors of Surgery and Long-Term Survival Following Lung Resection.	BACKGROUND: Lung resection is the preferred treatment option for lung cancer. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be denied surgery due to lung function impairment or other comorbidities. RESEARCH QUESTION: To describe the predictors of lung resection and long-term survival in patients with COPD with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with COPD treated for resectable NSCLC between 2009 and 2019 in a tertiary care hospital. The decision to operate or not followed a thorough clinical evaluation. Survival status was obtained from a provincial registry. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of surgery. A propensity score technique was used to control for confounding by indication. Hazard ratios (HR) for survival were estimated from a Cox regression model, adjusted for measured baseline confounders and propensity score as covariates. RESULTS: 1307 patients with COPD were included, including 918 who underwent surgery. 147 (38%) of those who did not have surgery were treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy, 86 (22%) with conventional radiotherapy and 156 (40%) did not receive any active treatment. Predictors of surgery included age, FEV(1), adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma, and stage IIA versus stage IA. Propensity score-adjusted survival was significantly reduced with non-surgical versus surgical approaches. INTERPRETATION: Lung resection was associated with better survival in patients with COPD and resectable lung cancer compared to non-surgical approaches.

Synthesis and Acidic pH-Responsive Disassembly of Dual-Location Shell-Sheddable/Core-Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoassemblies and Their Controlled Drug Delivery.	The development of acidic pH-responsive degradable amphiphilic block copolymers (ABPs) and their nanoassemblies has been extensively explored as a promising platform for tumor-targeting drug delivery and cancer therapy. Despite tremendous advances, most acidic pH-degradable ABP nanoassemblies have been designed with acid-labile groups positioned in a single location, such as the hydrophobic core or at the core/corona interface, limiting their control over degradation and thus causing an inefficient release profile of encapsulated therapeutics. Herein, we report a dual-location acidic pH-responsive degradation strategy involving the synthesis of acidic pH-degradable ABP-based nanoassemblies bearing two different acid-labile linkages in hydrophobic cores and at interfaces that exhibit an individually controlled and synergistically enhanced release profile of encapsulated therapeutics. Well-defined ABPs are designed with benzaldehyde acetal at the block junction (e.g., interfaces) and conjugated benzoic imine in the hydrophobic block (e.g., cores), synthesized by reversible deactivation radical polymerization. Colloidally stable nanoassemblies formed through aqueous micellization have an acidic pH response desired for tumor-targeting drug delivery, e.g., slow degradation at pH = 6.5 (tumoral pH) and rapid degradation at pH = 5.0 (endo/lysosomal pH), while the remaining stable at pH = 7.3 (physiological pH). When loaded with curcumin anticancer drugs, nanoassemblies achieve a high encapsulation efficiency. Curcumin-loaded nanoassemblies exhibit enhanced curcumin release at endo/lysosomal pH levels. Moreover, they exhibit promising antitumoral activity and intracellular trafficking to cancer cells, while empty nanoassemblies are noncytotoxic. These results highlight the potential of the dual-location, acidic pH-responsive degradation strategy as a versatile platform for the next generation of tumor-targeted drug delivery.

In synergy with interferon-gamma, interleukin-17 activates vascular stromal cells towards a pro-inflammatory profile in giant cell arteritis.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the role of IL-17 in Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), which has remained uncertain despite previous research suggesting a contribution of Th17 cells to the disease. METHODS: Temporal artery biopsies (TABs) were cultured ex vivo in MATRIGEL(R) with IL-17, secukinumab, or control IgG, and subsequently analyzed using bulk RNA-sequencing and RT-qPCR. Positive-TABs with GCA features were compared to negative-TABs or used to obtain in vitro cultures of myofibroblasts (MFs). Confocal microscopy analyzed IL-17 receptor expression. MFs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells co-cultures were used to study T-cell polarization. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis showed that secukinumab treatment of positive TABs reduced expression of genes linked to vascular inflammation, notably IL6. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that secukinumab decreased mRNA encoding IL-6, CCL20, and GM-CSF in positive-TABs, while IL-17 upregulated them in negative-TABs. No changes were observed regarding the expression of genes related to vascular remodeling. IL-17 receptor chains were expressed on MFs, and their expression was enhanced by IFN-gamma. RT-qPCR and Luminex(R) analyses confirmed IL-17-driven upregulation of IL-6, CCL20, CCL2, GM-CSF, and VEGF in MFs, which was reversed by secukinumab. Addition of IFN-gamma to the culture increased the expression level of IL-17 receptor chains, resulting in a synergistic effect. Additionally, IL-17 pre-treated MFs promoted Th17 polarization. CONCLUSIONS: IL-17 exacerbates vascular inflammation in GCA by activating MFs and synergizing with IFN-gamma to increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, GM-CSF), chemokines (CCL20, CCL2), and angiogenic factors (VEGF, indicating that IL-17 is a key contributor to disease pathogenesis.

RBC Alloimmunization Impacts Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Transplant Outcomes and Transfusion Burden: A STAR Registry Report.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and can become RBC alloimmunized. This study was designed to investigate if RBC alloimmunization before hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) was associated with post-HCT outcomes and transfusion support using the multicenter Sickle cell Transplant Advocacy and Research (STAR) retrospective registry. From a cohort of 229 pediatric patients with SCD who underwent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HCT with myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning, 40 patients (17%) were RBC alloimmunized pre-HCT. The RBC alloimmunized group had a significantly higher incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (15% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.013), which remained significant (OR 4.22, 95% CI, 1.19, 14.3; p = 0.027) when controlling for pre-HCT RBC transfusion burden and conditioning intensity. Graft failure occurred in 10% of RBC alloimmunized patients compared with 2.6% of non-alloimmunized patients, p = 0.052. Patients with RBC alloimmunization had lower 5-year severe GVHD-free, rejection-free survival (69% vs. 88%, p = 0.004), which remained significant when controlling for age. Post-HCT patients received a median 3 RBC units (IQR 2, 6) and 11 platelet transfusions (IQR 7, 19). Pre-HCT RBC alloimmunization was associated with a greater requirement for post-HCT platelet transfusions, but not post-HCT RBC units transfused. We postulate that the observed associations of pre-HCT RBC alloimmunization with severe acute GVHD and post-HCT platelet transfusion burden are due to inherent immunologic characteristics that render patients at increased risk of developing multiple immune-mediated complications.

Empirical first- and second-line eradication regimens for Helicobacter pylori adult-infected patients: a National Survey among Italian gastroenterologists and general practitioners.	OBJECTIVE: Despite national and international guidelines on Helicobacter pylori management, limited evidence exists on how these recommendations are applied in routine clinical practice. This nationwide survey, conducted by the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists and the Italian Federation of General Practitioners (FIMMG), aimed to identify the empirical first- and second-line treatments most commonly recommended in Italy. METHODS: Members of societies were invited via email to anonymously complete an original 20-item questionnaire. Ten therapeutic regimens were proposed, with treatment durations classified as 7, 10, or 14 days. Respondents reported the type of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) used, total daily dose (mg/day), and whether probiotics and/or lactoferrin were recommended. PPI doses were standardized according to acid inhibition potency and categorized as low, standard, or high. RESULTS: Among the 1262 respondents [358 gastroenterologists (GEs) and 904 general practitioners (GPs)], the first-line regimen most frequently prescribed was the triple therapy with PPI, clarithromycin and amoxicillin (35.2%; 12% of GEs vs. 44.4% of GPs; P < 0.0001), followed by bismuth quadruple therapy - three-in-one capsule (BQT-TSC: 31.2%; 51.4 vs. 23.3%, P < 0.001), and sequential therapy (21.7%; 26.8 vs. 19.7%, P < 0.001). For second-line, BQT-TSC was the most prescribed regimen (53.1%; GEs versus GSs: not statistically significant). 10-day courses and low-dose PPIs predominated, and approximately 1/3 of respondents recommended probiotics. CONCLUSION: Empirical regimen selection, PPI dosing, and probiotic use frequently diverged from guideline recommendations. These findings highlight the need to align clinical practice with evidence-based standards to improve eradication rates, optimize cost-effectiveness, and preserve healthcare resources.

Fat's All, Folks: Culturing and Manipulating Peri-Prostatic Adipocytes to Probe Impacts on Prostate Cancer Biology.	Obesity, officially recognised as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, will soon overtake smoking as the largest preventable risk factor for cancer. By 2035, more than half the world's population is expected to be overweight or obese with a significant increase in obesity-related health expenditures. However, despite the increase in prevalence and the overall lower life expectancy associated with obesity, mechanisms underpinning obesity-driven disease are not well understood. Adipocytes pose many challenges for in vitro culture due to their poor cell to surface attachment and low viability. Their large size and high lipid content can also present methodological challenges for downstream experiments. Several mouse and human-derived primary pre-adipocyte cell lines have been established over the years. However, they show limited renewal capacity and they cannot be cultured long term in vitro. Commercial cell lines available, which can be cultured long term, fail to represent organ-specific adipocyte heterogeneity. Adipose tissue from different organs and fat-depots can show significant heterogeneity in terms of metabolism, overall secretome and extracellular-matrix production. The prostate, for example, is surrounded by peri-prostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), volume of which is associated with increased risk of lethal prostate cancer and reduced therapy- response. Here we outline a protocol for ex vivo culture of fresh PPAT and non-prostatic adipose tissue (NPAT), which reflects donor and depot-specific characteristics. Ex vivo culture of PPAT/NPAT explants maintains cell-cell interactions and preserves local tissue architecture within adipose tissue. We have also described establishment of immortalised, patient PPAT-derived pre-adipocytes and patient-matched NPAT pre-adipocytes that can be in vitro-differentiated into mature adipocytes. The protocols outlined here could be readily adapted to other organ-specific fat depots such as mammary/bone marrow adipose tissue, and to tissues of non-human origin.

Risk factors and clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease in patients receiving cancer therapy.	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with chronic inflammation and increased malignancy risk; however, data on the effects of cancer therapies on the clinical course of IBD are limited. We evaluated the effects of cancer therapies on IBD activity and oncologic outcomes. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center and included patients with IBD and malignancy who received cancer therapy 2015-2023. Patient characteristics and comparisons between patients who did and did not develop gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) related to cancer therapy are presented. RESULTS: The cohort included 1153 patients, predominantly white (85.3%) and female (51.6%). GI AEs occurred in 296 (25.7%) patients. Those who developed GI AEs had more hematologic malignancies (21.6 vs. 14.6%; P = 0.005), stage III-IV cancer (55.1 vs. 45.6%; P < 0.0001), immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use (19.6 vs. 10.7%; P < 0.0001) and active baseline IBD status before cancer therapy (20.0 vs. 14.5%; P = 0.025). Stage III-IV disease (hazard ratio: 2.9, P < 0.0001), GI AEs (hazard ratio: 1.3, P = 0.008), GI AE-related hospitalization (hazard ratio: 2.1, P < 0.0001), and ICI (hazard ratio: 2.0, P < 0.0001) were associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSION: Concurrent management of IBD and cancer poses clinical challenges, particularly with the higher risk of GI AEs (25.7%) that is associated with active baseline IBD status and ICI use. These interactions may compromise treatment and survival. Further research is warranted to clarify the long-term impact of cancer therapies on IBD progression and outcomes.

The prognostic value of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing surgical resection.	OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in predicting postoperative outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after surgical resection. METHODS: Serum PIVKA‑II levels were compared between early‑stage (stage I+II) and advanced‑stage (stage III+IV) HCC patients. Correlations between PIVKA‑II and clinicopathological features were examined. Kaplan‑Meier curves were plotted to assess overall survival (OS) and recurrence‑free survival (RFS) by PIVKA‑II levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis compared the predictive performance of PIVKA‑II and alpha ‑fetoprotein (AFP), with DeLong 's test evaluating differences in area under the curve. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent prognostic factors for postoperative survival and recurrence. RESULTS: Serum PIVKA‑II levels were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with controls (P < 0.01), and were higher in advanced‑stage than early‑stage HCC (P < 0.01). PIVKA‑II correlated significantly with tumor diameter, tumor node metastasis classification, lymph node infiltration, distant metastasis, differentiation, and complication incidence (all P < 0.05). Patients with high PIVKA‑II (>/=100 mAU/ml) had shorter median OS and RFS than those with low levels (<100 mAU/ml) (P < 0.01). PIVKA‑II outperformed AFP in predicting 5‑year survival and recurrence (P < 0.05), and combined use improved predictive accuracy (P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression identified PIVKA‑II >/=100 mAU/ml as an independent prognostic factor for both OS and RFS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that serum PIVKA-II can serve as a prognostic predictor for HCC patients after surgical treatment.

Surveillance imaging detects hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in individuals with Fontan circulation.	PURPOSE: To describe institutional surveillance practices for hepatic neoplasms in people with Fontan circulation and report the number and types of biopsied lesions identified. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed surveillance liver imaging, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and histopathology in individuals with Fontan circulation cared for at our hospital between 2013 and 2022. Clinical information and subsequent management were reviewed. Imaging for hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) and malignant lesions was assessed for key diagnostic features. RESULTS: A total of 1110 liver imaging studies were performed in 686 individuals. Twenty-eight focal liver lesions (in 23 patients) were biopsied: 10 focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesions, seven HCA, seven hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), one cholangiocarcinoma, one hamartoma, one posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder lesion, and one hemangioma. Two HCAs demonstrated malignant transformation to HCC. Median ages at diagnosis were 17.5 years for HCA and 26.6 years for malignant tumors. Most HCAs (5/7) and HCCs (5/7) were initially detected with MRI. Only three of seven patients with HCC had elevated AFP prebiopsy. Imaging features - including arterial phase hyperenhancement, washout, fat content, and hepatobiliary phase hypointensity - substantially overlapped between HCAs and HCCs. Among patients with malignant neoplasms (n = 8), four died, three underwent percutaneous therapy followed by heart-liver transplantation, and one underwent ablation alone. CONCLUSION: Surveillance imaging in this cohort of children and adults with Fontan circulation identified hepatocellular neoplasms in patients as young as 15 years old. MRI detected most lesions, AFP was often normal in HCC, and substantial imaging overlap between HCAs and HCCs reinforces the need for multidisciplinary review to guide diagnosis and management.

Cytometric Atlas of Combination Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer: Blood-Based Signatures Reveal Vaccine and Checkpoint Inhibitor Responses.	Combination vaccine and checkpoint inhibitor therapy has previously demonstrated immunologic responses in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), although with limited efficacy. An urgent need to augment responses has warranted a deeper understanding of how each treatment modality contributes to the overall inflammatory response. Serial blood samples from PDAC patients treated with GVAX, CRS-207, anti-CTLA-4, and/or anti-PD-1 therapies were profiled using two mass cytometry panels. Generating 260 cytometric profiles from 64 unique patients allowed us to create an annotated PDAC immunotherapy atlas. Analysis of this atlas revealed that while GVAX alone did not significantly alter T-cell relative frequencies, it induced T-cell activation and upregulated checkpoint expression. Adding anti-PD-1 blockade to GVAX further enhanced T-cell activation, whereas adding anti-CTLA-4 distinctly enhanced memory formation. Vaccine-mediated effects were similar, but GVAX promoted plasmacytoid dendritic cells more than CRS-207. Derived phenotypic patterns could also be projected onto tumor imaging data, underscoring the potential for discoveries relating treatment-induced peripheral signatures to changes in the tumor microenvironment.

A randomized phase II study: CRS207/GVAX plus anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 recruits mesothelin- and mKRAS-specific T cells into PDAC.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains highly lethal and has poor immunogenicity, warranting the use of vaccines to guide and recruit the immune response. Building on prior efforts to achieve clinical immunotherapeutic responses against PDAC, we conducted a phase II study (NCT03190265) that combined attenuated mesothelin-secreting listeria vaccine (CRS-207) and GM-CSF-secreting allogeneic whole-cell vaccine (GVAX) along with checkpoint inhibition. Patients with metastatic PDAC who progressed on chemotherapy were enrolled in one of two treatment arms in a randomized fashion. CRS-207 was given with anti-PD1 (nivolumab) and anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) with (Arm A) or without (Arm B) GVAX. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoint was safety. 57 patients received at least one dose of treatment, with 2 partial responses (4% ORR), both Arm B. The response rates were not significantly different between the two arms. Related grade >/=3 adverse events were seen in 39 (68%) patients, including 33 events attributed to CRS-207. Mass cytometry analysis of serially obtained biospecimens demonstrated treatment-induced promotion of T-cell memory and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Peptide-specific T-cell expansions in vitro followed by T-cell receptor sequencing revealed clones specific to mesothelin and mutant KRAS within the tumor. Accompanying these antitumor T-cell responses was significant enrichment of myeloid cells. High myeloid and Treg signatures correlated with poor responses. We conclude that GVAX/CRS-207 plus nivolumab and ipilimumab successfully generates and expands T-cell clones specific to mesothelin and mutant KRAS within the PDAC TME but immunotherapy-induced myeloid-cell enrichment remains a barrier to greater efficacy.

Selective Membrane Protein Enrichment Enables Defined Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Endothelial Targeting.	Nanoparticles offer a promising strategy for targeted drug delivery while reducing off-target toxicity. Biomimetic nanoparticles, which integrate native cell components, enhance biological compatibility but often suffer from poorly defined protein compositions that hinder reproducibility and clinical translation. Here, we present a next-generation biomimetic approach to engineer Particular Nanoparticles (PNPs)- formulation enriched with specific, functionally relevant membrane proteins for precise control and tunability. We incorporated leukocyte adhesion proteins (including CD18, CD11a, and CD11b) into the nanoparticle membrane to enhance targeting of inflamed sites. Using a 2D microfluidic model that mimics human blood vessels, adhesion-enriched PNPs demonstrated significantly improved endothelial interactions and greater accumulation under flow at inflamed endothelium compared to conventional Leukosomes. This protein-defined biomimetic nanoparticle platform offers enhanced targeting efficiency, improved reproducibility, and translational potential for inflammation-targeted therapies.

First-Year IgG Dynamics in IgG4-Related Disease: A Critical Window for Predicting Long-Term Outcomes.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate longitudinal serum IgG dynamics in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) after treatment and assess their prognostic value for relapse. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 274 newly treated IgG4-RD patients was stratified into elevated IgG (n=186) and normal IgG (n=88) groups. Treatment responses were evaluated by covariance analysis adjusted for baseline IgG. Longitudinal IgG trends and relapse risk were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. RESULTS: levated baseline IgG was associated with more severe phenotypes, including male predominance, older age, higher responder index scores, more internal organ involvement, hypocomplementemia, and elevated ESR/CRP. IgG1 and IgG4 mainly contributed to IgG elevation. After treatment, 79.6% of elevated patients achieved normalization, with the greatest decline in the first year. Glucocorticoid (GC)-based regimens reduced IgG more effectively than GC-sparing therapies and achieved higher normalization rates (85.2% vs. 66.7%). 12-month IgG normalization strongly predicted reduced relapse risk. Patients achieving IgG normalization had lower relapse rates (17.9% vs. 44.1%, p=0.001) and superior relapse-free survival [33.20 (32.21-34.19) vs. 27.71 (24.29-31.13) months, log-rank p<0.001]. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed failure of 12-month IgG normalization [HR 2.67 (1.43-4.99), p=0.002] and treatment intensity (GCs + weak IMs: HR 0.36, p=0.012; GCs + potent IMs: HR 0.40, p=0.020, vs. GC-sparing) as independent relapse determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline IgG elevation marks more severe IgG4-RD phenotypes. The first treatment year achieving IgG normalization represents a critical prognostic biomarker. Failure to normalize IgG within 12 months markedly increases relapse risk. Longitudinal IgG monitoring supports risk stratification and treatment optimization.

Cabozantinib for Advanced Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors: Subgroup Analysis of the Phase 3 CABINET Trial (Alliance A021602).	BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have recently been described as a distinct category, and randomized data regarding efficacy of therapy for these patients are scarce. In the phase 3 CABINET trial, cabozantinib improved PFS compared with placebo in patients with advanced, previously treated, progressive extra-pancreatic NET (epNET) and pancreatic NET (pNET) of all grades. Here, we evaluate if these results remain consistent in a subgroup of patients with well-differentiated G3 NET. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic epNET or pNET were randomized 2:1 in independent cohorts to receive cabozantinib 60 mg daily vs placebo. We analyzed outcomes of the subset of patients with G3 NETs (Ki67>20%), combining patients in the pNET and epNET cohorts due to small sample sizes. RESULTS: 24 patients had G3 NETs, 16 randomized to cabozantinib and 8 to placebo. Primary sites included pancreas (n=12); GI tract (n=7); unknown primary (n=3); lung/ thymus (n=2). Median PFS for patients with G3 NET treated with cabozantinib was 7.9 months vs 3 months with placebo (HR=0.15,95% CI:0.04-0.57, 1-sided log-rank P=0.0034). The confirmed overall radiographic response rate was 25% (4/16) with cabozantinib vs. 0% (0/8) with placebo. Safety outcomes were consistent with published data for the trial as a whole. CONCLUSION: Subset analysis of the CABINET trial showed improved PFS associated with cabozantinib vs placebo for G3 NETs of pancreatic and extra-pancreatic origin. Despite limited numbers, these results suggest that cabozantinib can be an effective option for patients with advanced G3 NETs.

Personalizing therapies over the course of hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.	The hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer subtype accounts for most early and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cases. HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC is characterized by a relatively prolonged, although variable, disease course and substantial intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. Although endocrine-based therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment, nearly all patients eventually develop resistance, which is increasingly addressed with biologically targeted agents and newer-generation cytotoxic drugs. This review summarizes the current understanding of HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC biology, highlighting mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance, including driver genomic alterations that, along with clinical factors, help guide therapeutic choices and sequencing. The authors specify and discuss how genomic and transcriptomic profiling inform treatment selection and how side effects and overall patient experience are considered in decision making. Advances in targeted therapies, such as CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and AKT (protein kinase B) inhibitors, and next-generation estrogen receptor degraders are reviewed along with the expanding role of antibody-drug conjugates and biomarker-guided tumor-agnostic biologic therapies. The authors also explore evolving biologic concepts, including the impact of the tumor microenvironment on resistance and disease progression, and consider the distinct clinical behavior of invasive lobular carcinoma and current approaches. Emerging data from contemporary clinical trials promise to refine clinical and biomarker-driven algorithms and improve outcomes for patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC. Ongoing multi-omic research and adaptive clinical strategies will be essential to further the application of precision oncology in this most common subtype of MBC. Importantly, patient-reported outcomes, shared decision making, and real-world evidence are increasingly useful in formulating comprehensive care plans, guidelines, and policy. The modern treatment landscape features a personalized approach that integrates clinical features, biomarkers, and patient preferences across the disease continuum.

Treatment and Outcomes of Children and Adults With Rhabdomyosarcoma in Rwanda.	BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma affecting children and young adults, but few reports describe its presentation and outcomes in Africa. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients of all ages with RMS presenting to the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence in Rwanda between July 2012 and June 2022. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with histopathologically confirmed RMS were treated using Intergroup RMS Study Group protocols adapted to the local context. Median age was 9.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5-16.6); 54.2% were female. Median duration from symptom onset to presentation was 5 months (IQR 4-7). Most had embryonal histology (66.1%), followed by alveolar (20.3%), pleomorphic (6.8%), and anaplastic (1.7%). At presentation, 16 patients (27.1%) had stage I, 3 (5.1%) had stage II, 22 (37.3%) had stage III, and 14 (23.7%) had stage IV disease; 4 (6.8%) were unstaged. Of the 39 patients treated with curative intent, 25 (64.1%) received local control and 16 (41.0%) completed all planned therapy. Two-year event-free survival was 23.3% (95% CI 13.5%-34.8%, n = 55) overall and 61.4% (95% CI 33.3%-80.5%, n = 16) among those who completed treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of RMS in a rural district hospital is feasible. Although outcomes remain lower than in high-income countries, survival was markedly higher in patients who completed therapy. Future efforts should focus on earlier diagnosis and support for timely transitions between specialties with the goal of optimizing completion of planned care.

Transient absorption spectroscopy: a mechanistic tool for triplet sensitizers and their applications.	Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is a well-known technique used to study events that take place upon photoexcitation at short time scales (usually from femtoseconds to nanoseconds and up to milli-seconds) and involve processes such as electron transfer, energy transfer, intersystem crossing, isomerization, proton transfer, exciplex or excimer formation, etc. These events are fundamental steps for the mechanisms of many chemical processes including organic synthetic reactions, photo-polymerization, photodynamic therapy, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. In this review we thoroughly discuss and critically analyze how to exploit TAS to derive mechanistic insights in these processes. Moreover, some basic principles that can help in easily elucidating and predicting a transient absorption (TA) spectrum are included with previously reported examples. This paper is aimed at facilitating the application of TAS as a tool for mechanistic studies and to provide an overview of the techniques related to scientists and students with diverse scientific backgrounds.

Mesoporous Silica: A Promising Adjuvant for Cancer Vaccines.	Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology by utilizing the body's immune system to fight cancer. Unlike traditional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, immunotherapy enhances the body's immune capacity, enabling it to target and eliminate cancer cells accurately. However, there are still challenges associated with immunotherapy, including limited efficacy, drug resistance, potential side effects, and difficulties in patient selection. Mesoporous silica (MS) particles have been investigated for enhancing cancer immunotherapy due to their advantageous structural features, excellent drug-delivery properties, and intrinsic immune-activation modulation capabilities. This review mainly focuses on the latest research progress of MS particle-based cancer vaccine adjuvants. First, we will give an overview of the progress in cancer immunotherapy. Second, we will introduce the applications of inorganic materials in cancer vaccines. Third, we will focus on the latest progress in the application of MS particles in cancer vaccine adjuvants. Finally, we conclude this review by outlining the challenges and future perspectives of MS particle-based cancer vaccine adjuvants.

Heterogeneous Response After [177Lu]Lu-FAPI-2286 Combination Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer.	A 37-year-old woman with metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma, resistant to anti-HER2 therapy, underwent [177Lu]Lu-FAPI-2286 radionuclide therapy combined with antibody-drug conjugate chemotherapy. Baseline [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-2286 PET/CT confirmed extensive fibroblast activation protein expression in metastatic sites. After 5 cycles, follow-up imaging showed a significant reduction in FAPI uptake in skin lesions, resolution of bone lesions, and decreased pleural thickening. Clinically, the patient reported pain relief and resolution of lymphedema. However, new metastases emerged in cervical, mediastinal, and abdominopelvic lymph nodes, indicating a heterogeneous response, and biopsy of these newly emerged lymph nodes confirmed disease recurrence.

Utility of (18)F-Flotufolastat PET/CT Imaging in High-Risk Prostate Cancer in a Real-World Setting.	INTRODUCTION: This investigator-initiated, prospective low-intervention phase 3 study evaluated the clinical utility of PSMA PET/CT imaging with (18)F-flotufolastat (formerly (18)F-rhPSMA-7.3) in men with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer and negative conventional imaging. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinical upstaging and its effect on subsequent management. METHODS: A total of 113 treatment-naive men meeting NCCN high-risk criteria were enrolled; 110 underwent PSMA PET/CT with (18)F-flotufolastat. Prior to imaging, all patients had negative conventional staging, as determined by bone scan and CT or MRI. Imaging was performed 50-70 minutes post-injection of 8 mCi +/- 20% (18)F-flotufolastat. Results were interpreted by board-certified nuclear medicine physicians trained in PSMA imaging. RESULTS: (18)F-flotufolastat identified extraprostatic disease in 36 of 110 patients (32.7%). Among these, 15 of 36 (41.7%) had isolated regional lymph node (N1) involvement, while 21 of 36 (58.3%) demonstrated distant metastatic (M1) disease. Of the patients who were upstaged, 34 of 36 patients (94.4%) had a change in their treatment plan. The most common treatment intensification included the addition of an androgen receptor inhibitor and expanded radiotherapy fields (50.0%). Further, 34.3% received upfront chemotherapy alongside an androgen receptor inhibitor and radiation. A minority (8.6%) proceeded with radical prostatectomy as a first step of a multimodality approach. CONCLUSION: PSMA PET/CT with (18)F-flotufolastat led to clinical upstaging in nearly one-third of men with high-risk prostate cancer and negative conventional imaging, resulting in significant treatment change in most patients. These findings support the integration of PSMA-targeted imaging into initial staging pathways for men with high-risk prostate cancer.

Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis of Clinical Outcomes in Patients With High-Risk Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer: Results From a 3-Year Interim Analysis of the J-ROCK Study.	INTRODUCTION: In real-world practice in Japan, standard treatment for metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), administered as monotherapy, combined androgen blockade (CAB), ADT plus androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), or ADT plus docetaxel. In a previous interim analysis of the large-scale, longitudinal, multicentre, J-ROCK registry study of real-world clinical and patient-reported outcomes, ADT plus ARPI or ADT plus docetaxel was used more frequently than ADT/CAB in patients (aged >/= 20 years) with newly diagnosed LATITUDE-criteria high-risk mHNPC. METHODS: This post hoc analysis of the J-ROCK study evaluated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, progression-free survival (PFS), time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), overall survival (OS) and safety in patients with high-risk mHNPC who received ADT/CAB (cohort 1) or ADT plus ARPI (cohort 2B) in subgroups were defined according to the following known prognostic factors at baseline: age, Gleason Grade Group (GGG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin (Hb) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). RESULTS: This analysis included 947 evaluable patients (371 in cohort 1 and 576 in cohort 2B). PSA response rates remained similar among age and GGG subgroups in both cohorts, but were reduced in cohort 2B patients with elevated ALP, low Hb, and elevated LDH. Time to CRPC and OS were longer in cohort 2B than in cohort 1, regardless of prognostic factors. Among patients with poor prognosis (older, high GGG, low Hb, elevated LDH), OS decline occurred earlier in cohort 1 versus cohort 2B. A trend towards a plateau in the time to CRPC curve was observed in both cohorts, even in patients with poor prognosis. Safety data were not affected by prognostic factors or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that novel ADT plus ARPI regimens for LATITUDE-criteria high-risk mHNPC may improve real-world outcomes compared with ADT monotherapy or CAB, particularly among patients with poor prognosis.

FAST-CRISPR: Fusogenic Association and Secured Transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 Ribonucleoproteins Using Lipid-Silica Hybrid Nanoparticles for Therapeutic Genome Editing.	Clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics is challenged by inefficient cytosolic delivery and toxicity issues associated with viral vectors and nanoparticle-based carriers. To overcome these concerns, herein we report a lipid-silica hybrid nanoparticle platform for fusogenic association and secured transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 (FAST-CRISPR), designed for rapid cytosolic delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins, followed by efficient gene editing. Through direct fusion with the plasma membrane and bypassing conventional endocytic barriers, FAST-CRISPR nanoparticles displayed superior intracellular delivery efficacy. Optimizing lipid compositions, we discovered that a 1:1 weight mixture of cationic DOTAP and ionizable DODMA lipids, combined with tailored large-pore silica nanoparticles, enables enhanced loading capacity, rapid cytosolic dispersion, and significant nuclear transport of Cas9/gRNA complexes. FAST-CRISPR nanoparticles efficiently delivered multiplex genome-targeting ribonucleoproteins to induce targeted double-strand DNA breaks, triggering apoptosis in cancer cells and significantly suppressing tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model without systemic toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy and translational potential of FAST-CRISPR nanoparticles as a safe and versatile non-viral delivery platform for precision genome editing.

Patient-Level Barriers and Facilitators to Inpatient Physical Therapy in Adolescents and Young Adults With a Hematological Malignancy: A Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: Despite their increased risk for functional impairment resulting from cancer and its treatments, few adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with a hematological malignancy receive the recommended or therapeutic dose of exercise per week during inpatient hospitalizations. Physical therapy (PT) plays a critical role in promoting and supporting exercise in the hospital setting; however, little is known about the factors that influence AYA engagement in PT. This qualitative study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators to inpatient PT through the perspectives of AYAs and healthcare providers. PROCEDURE: AYAs with cancer (n = 14) and healthcare providers (n = 9) were recruited at a pediatric academic medical center. Participants completed a semi-structured interview assessing barriers and facilitators to inpatient PT adherence. Interviews were video/audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded. Codes and themes were developed iteratively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: AYAs (15-29 years, M = 18.95, SD = 3.68) and healthcare providers discussed four primary themes affecting inpatient PT engagement. The themes suggested that social support from family and friends, AYAs' individual goals, and individualized PT programs improved motivation to participate. In contrast, treatment side effects and treatment demands limited AYA inpatient PT engagement. CONCLUSIONS: AYA engagement and motivation for inpatient PT vary with the individual's circumstances, goals, health, and social support. Evidence-based behavior change techniques may support future intervention efforts in addressing barriers specific to inpatient PT adherence in AYAs with hematological malignancies.

Comparing Parent and Child Reports of School Functioning as Predictors of Neurocognitive Test Performance in Hispanic/Latino Survivors of Childhood Leukemia/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.	INTRODUCTION: Survivors of childhood leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma are at risk of treatment-related cognitive sequelae and poor educational outcomes. Child self-report could be a resource-efficient screening tool for identifying those in need of further assessment and intervention; however, it has not been empirically evaluated. This study investigated parent- and child-reported school functioning as predictors of performance on objective cognitive and academic measures in school-age Hispanic/Latino survivors. METHODS: One hundred and six Hispanic/Latino survivors of leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma, ages 6-12 years, completed neurocognitive assessments. Parent- and child-reported school functioning was measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales. Multivariate regression models examined associations between parent-report and child self-report of school functioning and performance in cognitive and academic domains, adjusted for relevant demographic and treatment covariates. The model fit of parent and child as predictors was compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Child age was explored as a moderating factor. RESULTS: Higher child-reported school functioning was significantly associated with better Processing Speed (p < 0.001), Working Memory (p = 0.038), and Reading performance (p = 0.033). In contrast, higher parent-reported school functioning was only significantly associated with better Processing Speed (p = 0.026). Models using child self-report showed stronger associations with all outcomes and demonstrated better fit to the data, as indicated by lower AIC values, compared to models using parent-report. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the potential utility of child-reported school functioning in future screening efforts to identify school-age survivors in need of additional evaluation or support.

Development of self-assembled peptide hydrogels containing matrix-metalloproteinase degradable motifs for 3D lung cancer models.	Hydrogel-forming peptides, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable motifs, have been employed to investigate cell-extracellular matrix interactions in vitro. However, their potential in 3D cancer models has been explored only in a few studies. In this study, we used modified MMP-2 degradable motifs (VSLRA or ASLRA) in the design of EDP1 (RVSLRADARVSLRADA) and EDP2 (RASLRADARASLRADA) peptide hydrogelators. The peptides self-assembled into nanofibrillar hydrogels with storage moduli between  approximately 300 and  approximately 400 Pa. MMP-2 degradation properties of the peptides were confirmed, and a slightly higher MMP-2 responsiveness of the EDP1 hydrogel was observed. The hydrogels were used in the encapsulation of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells and MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells. The designed hydrogels supported the proliferation of these cells with high viability and induced cluster formation of encapsulated A549 cells similar to that observed with the RADA hydrogel. However, the hydrogel network structure affected the morphology of the migrated cells in the absence of curcumin. The addition of curcumin decreased the migration and invasion of A549 cells, resulting in a round cell morphology independent of the hydrogel matrices. Anticancer drug tests indicated that cell viability after drug treatment was higher in the 3D hydrogels than in 2D cultures. It was also confirmed that the combinational therapy of doxorubicin and curcumin decreased the cell proliferation and colonization to a greater extent compared to doxorubicin monotherapy. Thus, the hydrogels developed in this study can be used for 3D cancer models or other tissue engineering applications as an alternative to the RADA hydrogel by exploiting the MMP-2 degradation properties.

Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of A+AVD vs PET-guided ABVD in newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.	AIMS: The study team investigated the relative efficacy of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) versus positron emission tomography (PET)-guided doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) among previously untreated adults with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma via matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). MATERIALS & METHODS: A systematic literature review identified ECHELON-1 (A+AVD), RATHL, and SWOG S0816 as feasible trials referencing a targeted comparator (PET-guided ABVD). Effect modifiers/prognostic variables were identified by clinical expert opinion and Cox regression using long-term ECHELON-1 individual patient-level data. Weighted Cox regressions generated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) representing A+AVD versus PET-guided ABVD relative treatment effect on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: OS improved significantly with A+AVD versus PET-guided ABVD (HR [95% CI] 0.48 [0.32, 0.73], p < 0.001 [RATHL]; 0.49 [0.26, 0.92], p = 0.043 [SWOG S0816]). PFS significantly favored A+AVD over PET-guided ABVD in both trial comparisons. While the proportional hazards assumption did not hold for these comparisons, 8-year restricted mean survival time and piecewise Cox regression results aligned with the main results. CONCLUSION: MAIC results indicated durable A+AVD treatment benefits in adults with newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma versus PET-guided regimens evaluated in RATHL and SWOG S0816.

Quality of life of patients with Kaposi Sarcoma: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative tumor linked to Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) infection, presenting in five clinical variants. While much research has focused on its clinical characteristics and treatment, limited data exist on its psychological impact and effect on quality of life (QoL). This study aims to evaluate the emotional burden of KS in a large cohort of Italian patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Milan, Italy, from January to December 2023. Patients with KS were recruited and completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short version (DASS-21). Clinical and demographic data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and Student's t-test to compare QoL scores with general population norms. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients (82.6% male; mean age 75.7 years) participated. The majority (93.3%) had lesions on the lower limbs, with 40.8% presenting visible lesions. Compared to the general population, KS patients had significantly lower cognitive functioning scores (P=0.0217) but higher global health status scores (P=0.0070). Moderate-severe depression, anxiety, and stress were reported in 14.2%, 15.8%, and 15.0% of patients, respectively. Visceral involvement was significantly associated with moderate-severe depression (P=0.013), whereas lesion staging did not correlate with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Despite stable physical health, KS patients experience a significant psychological burden, particularly those with visceral involvement or visible lesions. These findings underscore the need for integrated psychological support to improve coping strategies and overall well-being in KS patients. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to further investigate the evolving psychological impact of KS.

Cost-effectiveness of female-only and gender-neutral HPV vaccination strategies in Japan.	AIMS: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of female-only vaccination (FOV) and gender-neutral vaccination strategies (GNV) using 4-valent (4vHPV) and 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccines among adolescents aged 12-16 years in Japan. It provides the first comprehensive assessment of all feasible vaccine-population combinations using a unified dynamic transmission model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An age- and sex-structured dynamic transmission model simulated HPV transmission and disease progression over 100 years, incorporating cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, head and neck, and penile cancers. Six vaccination strategies were evaluated: no further vaccination, FOV with 4vHPV, FOV with 9vHPV, GNV with 9vHPV for females and 4vHPV for males, GNV with 4vHPV for both sexes, and GNV with 9vHPV for both sexes. Analyses adopted a healthcare payer perspective, with costs in 2025 Japanese yen, discounted at 3%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of  yen5 million per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: FOV with 4vHPV yielded an ICER of  yen171,725/QALY versus no vaccination, and FOV with 9vHPV yielded  yen1,366,226/QALY versus FOV with 4vHPV - both below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Furthermore, GNV with 9vHPV for both sexes provided the greatest health gains and remained below the threshold ( yen3,594,296/QALY) versus FOV with 9vHPV. GNV with 4vHPV and mixed 9vHPV/4vHPV schedules were dominated and excluded. LIMITATIONS: The healthcare payer perspective excludes indirect costs. The model hypothetically includes 9vHPV for boys despite its unavailability for males in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Both female-only 4vHPV and 9vHPV strategies are cost-effective under Japan's economic standards. Furthermore, GNV with 9vHPV provides greater health benefits and cost-effectiveness.

The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) has emerged as a compelling genetically and pharmacologically validated target for nonhormonal male contraception due to its essential role in spermatogenesis. In the present study, a search for specific inhibitors of RARalpha utilized systematic linker bioisosterism, hydrophobic core modification, and iterative structure-activity relationship refinement, identified the acid 9, a pyrrole-linked analog that potently inhibits RARalpha (IC(50) = 1.2 nM) with >300-fold selectivity over RARbeta and RARgamma. Sprague-Dawley rat studies with the sodium salt of 9, YCT-529, showed good oral bioavailability and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics without drug accumulation after 28 days of dosing. Once-daily oral administration (0.75 mg/kg for 28 days) reversibly suppressed epididymal sperm counts and fertility in rats, with a no-observed-adverse-effect level at 30 mg/kg (highest dose tested), affording a >/=40-fold therapeutic window. These findings validated aromatic linker substitution as a powerful design strategy for identifying RARalpha antagonists and led to the clinical advancement of YCT-529 as a nonhormonal male contraceptive.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) for response prediction of neoadjuvant radio(chemo)therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in the Netherlands.	BACKGROUND: Given the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing importance of understanding AI's economic impact, this study aims to provide insights into the potential cost-effectiveness of an AI tool in the response prediction to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) of Stage II-III LARC patients in comparison to usual care (UC). METHODS: This study included a state-transition Markov model from a Dutch societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs were simulated over a 10-year horizon. Sensitivity analyses and a threshold analysis were performed. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: With incremental cost savings of -euro2,530,000 per QALY gained per 1000 patients, the AI is dominant in the base-case. Main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the clinical complete response incidence and specificity of the tool. Cost-effectiveness was maintained at a cost of euro1,100 and euro2,100 for an AI performance of 0.85 and 0.90. DISCUSSION: Findings of this study present the economic impact of a hypothetical AI-based approach to treatment response prediction in Stage II-III LARC patients who receive nCRT and are eligible for consecutive surgery. The results of this study highlight the complexity of healthcare decision-making in tools that could be cost-saving yet yield lower effectiveness when parameters are uncertain.

Development and External Validation of a Multivariable Model to Predict Early Minimal Symptom Expression Response in Adult Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Patients Treated With Efgartigimod.	BACKGROUND: Efgartigimod, a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker, is approved for generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG), but predictors of early response are unclear. Using minimal symptom expression (MSE) as the therapeutic target, we developed and externally validated a clinical model to predict early MSE response after starting efgartigimod. This efgartigimod-tailored model estimates the baseline probability of achieving early MSE and may assist in individualized treatment selection at therapy initiation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 118 adults with gMG treated at five tertiary centers in China (efgartigimod 10 mg/kg IV weekly x4). MSE was defined as Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) </= 1 sustained >/= 4 weeks; early MSE response was achievement within 4 weeks of initiation. Patients were split into a derivation cohort (n = 64; three centers) and an external validation cohort (n = 54; two centers). Candidate predictors included demographics, baseline severity, and laboratory indices. Variables associated with early MSE in univariable analyses entered multivariable logistic regression to construct a nomogram. Discrimination (AUC-ROC), calibration (curves and Spiegelhalter Z-test), and clinical utility (decision curve analysis, DCA) were assessed, with bootstrap internal validation. RESULTS: Early MSE response occurred in 26/64 derivation and 22/54 validation patients. Lower bulbar MG-ADL (OR 0.633, p = 0.040), higher FVC% (OR 1.042, p = 0.048), and lower IgG (OR 0.795, p = 0.036) independently predicted early MSE response. The nomogram showed strong discrimination-derivation AUC 0.869 (95% CI 0.797-0.941), bootstrap AUC 0.880 (0.806-0.954), and external AUC 0.839 (0.760-0.919)-and good calibration (Spiegelhalter Z: 1.03, p = 0.303; 0.94, p = 0.347; 1.17, p = 0.242). DCA indicated net benefit across thresholds 0.05-0.82, with validation curves mirroring derivation. CONCLUSIONS: A three-factor nomogram (bulbar MG-ADL, FVC%, and serum IgG) provides an efgartigimod-specific baseline estimate of early sustained-MSE response probability, which may help neurologists select appropriate candidates, counsel expected benefit, and tailor follow-up intensity or alternative escalation strategies.

Combined Epidural-General Anesthesia is Associated with Increased Postoperative Complications in Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Gastrointestinal Radical Surgery: A Propensity Score Weighting Study.	BACKGROUND: Combined epidural-general anesthesia (TEA+GA) can enhance postoperative recovery after gastrointestinal surgery. However, in patients receiving preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), a known risk factor for postoperative complications, it remains unclear whether TEA+GA improves postoperative outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 365 patients with NACT followed by radical resection of gastrointestinal cancer at Zhongshan Hospital between January 2020 and December 2022. TEA was initiated before the induction of GA. The primary outcome was the incidence of any postoperative in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative sufentanil consumption, hypotension, vasopressor use, extubation time, post-anesthesia care unit stay, postoperative hospital length of stay, and intensive care unit admission. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and overlap weighting (OW) were applied to adjust for baseline differences. RESULTS: Of the 365 patients, 152 received TEA+GA, while 213 received GA alone. TEA+GA was associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications (23.7% vs. 15.0%, OR [95% CI]: 1.76 (1.05-2.96), p = 0.036) without subgroup difference. This association remained significant after IPTW (24.1% vs 11.7%, OR [95% CI]: 2.39 [1.24-4.59], p = 0.009) and OW (23.3% vs 10.4%; OR [95% CI]: 2.62 [1.36-5.08], p = 0.004) adjustment. The TEA+GA group had a lower dose of intraoperative sufentanil use and shorter extubation times but showed a higher rate of intraoperative hypotension and increased vasopressor requirements. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent NACT followed by gastrointestinal radical surgery, Combined epidural-general anesthesia was associated with an increased incidence of postoperative in-hospital complications.

Gastric Metastases from Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast: Case Report and Literature Review.	Gastric metastases from breast cancer are rare clinical entities that often mimic primary gastric malignancies, leading to diagnostic delay. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), due to its diffuse growth pattern and loss of E-cadherin expression, demonstrates a higher propensity for metastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract.Authors report the case of a 42-year-old woman with bilateral stage IV ILC who subsequently developed bilateral ovarian and gastric metastases. We discuss the clinical, histopathologic, and imaging features, with emphasis on differential diagnosis and therapeutic strategies considering current evidence.This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of gastric metastases from ILC, which may present many years after the initial diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemistry to distinguish metastatic breast carcinoma from primary gastric carcinoma. Systemic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, while surgical intervention should be reserved for selected palliative indications. Increased awareness of this rare manifestation is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis and optimize multidisciplinary management.

Targeting Peptostreptococcus anaerobius with an Iron-Based Nanozyme Reverses Ferroptosis Resistance and Enhances Antitumor Immunity in Colorectal Cancer.	The intratumoral microbiota is a critical determinant of therapeutic outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although several microbial species have been identified that influence CRC development and treatment resistance, effective strategies for precisely modulating these bacteria remain limited. In this study, we identify Peptostreptococcus anaerobius as a tumor-enriched anaerobe that promotes CRC progression by inhibiting ferroptosis. To counteract this, we engineered a composite iron-based nanozyme encapsulating lincomycin, which selectively targets and eradicates intratumoral P. anaerobius, thereby reversing ferroptosis resistance in CRC. Simultaneously, the nanozyme's inherent peroxidase (POD) like activity catalyzes hydroxyl radical generation, enhancing intracellular oxidative stress and promoting ferroptosis. This dual mechanism-microbial clearance and ROS-mediated ferroptosis induction-synergistically suppresses tumor growth. Moreover, ferroptotic cancer cells release large amounts of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Our findings highlight a novel ferroptosis-centered therapeutic strategy integrating microbiota modulation and catalytic nanomedicine for precise CRC treatment.

Elemene Augments the Effects of Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy on Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Regulating the miR-130a-5p/SPP/MHC-I Axis.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD-1 inhibitors, constitute the cornerstone of first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, suboptimal overall response rates persist alongside dual challenges: immune-related toxicities and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Combination therapies represent a pivotal strategy to overcome these limitations. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine has gained significant attention. Elemene, a small-molecule compound derived from Curcuma wenyujin, has garnered attention for its immunomodulatory potential and demonstrates clinical efficacy in combination therapies. Nevertheless, its synergistic mechanisms with immunotherapy remain incompletely characterized. This study demonstrates for the first time that elemene modulates the miR-130a-5p/SPP/MHC-I axis, resulting in an enhanced diversity and abundance of antigen/MHC-I complexes on the surface of HCC cells. This mechanism promotes the recognition and elimination of HCC cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thereby augmenting the antitumor immune efficacy of PD-1. Moreover, the functional significance of the miR-130a-5p/SPP/MHC-I axis in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment is systematically validated through in vitro and in vivo HCC models, as well as in clinical patient specimens. These findings underscore the potential of combining elemene with anti-PD-1 therapy as a safe and effective treatment strategy for HCC, offering significant translational promise for improving patient outcomes.

[Changes in the metabolomic profile of blood plasma in patients with lymphoma during polychemotherapy].	BACKGROUND: Metabolomics studies in oncology provide a deeper understanding of the biochemical processes associated with tumor growth and the body's response to treatment. In patients with lymphoma, systemic metabolic changes remain poorly understood despite their high clinical significance. AIM: To evaluate changes in the metabolomic profile of blood plasma in patients with lymphoma at various stages of polychemotherapy (PCT) and compare them to those of healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 18 patients with lymphoma from whom blood was collected before treatment and after the first and third courses of PCT. The control group included 30 healthy volunteers. The analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and included measurements of amino acids, tryptophan and arginine derivatives, and acylcarnitines. Statistical processing was performed using analysis of variance and principal component analysis. RESULTS: Prior to therapy, patients showed characteristic metabolic disorders: activation of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, a decrease in arginine, and an increase in its methylated derivatives, as well as shifts in the amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles. During PCT, partial normalization of these indicators was observed, especially for the serotonin-melatonin cascade and kynurenine metabolites. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics analysis revealed characteristic biochemical changes in patients with lymphoma and their changes over time during treatment. The data obtained emphasize the potential of metabolomics as a tool for monitoring treatment effectiveness and patient condition in oncology.

Impact of county financial assistance on cancer treatment and survival among uninsured patients.	BACKGROUND: Texas has the largest uninsured population in the country. To cover medical costs of uninsured patients, multiple counties offer Financial Assistance Programs (FAPs). The association of these programs with access to cancer treatment and survival has not been studied. METHODS: Population-based Texas Cancer Registry was used to include uninsured patients aged 18 to 64 years and diagnosed with liver, lung, or pancreatic cancer from 2017 to 2021. County FAP status was ascertained from official county or county hospital websites. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to determine the adjusted odds of receipt of any cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation). Subsample analyses were performed for patients with non-metastatic cancer and residents of metropolitan areas. Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards analyses were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 5,477 uninsured patients, 47.7% were reported to have received cancer treatment. On multivariable analysis, living in a county that offered (vs. did not offer) FAPs was associated with 1.49 higher odds of receiving cancer treatment (95%CI: 1.28-1.73). Survival analysis indicated that the Hazards of death were 44% to 55% lower for patients who received cancer treatment and lived in FAP counties (vs. did not receive cancer treatment and did not live in FAP Counties). RELEVANCE: For uninsured patients with cancer, residence in a county that offers financial assistance was associated with significantly increased odds of receiving treatment and significantly lower hazards of death. These findings provide evidence for policy interventions that may improve cancer care and outcomes for uninsured patients.

An Injectable Hydrogel with Stepwise Drug Release for Chemo-Photothermal Therapy of Tumors.	Traditional chemotherapy drugs are not sustainably released and need to be administered multiple times, often leading to drug resistance and systemic toxicity. In this work, we designed a novel injectable hydrogel, made of chitosan and beta-glycerophosphate, to codeliver chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO) and MTO-loaded PEGylated black phosphorus quantum dots (BP-PEG-MTO/MTO@Gel) for chemo-photothermal therapy of tumors with stepwise drug release. The hydrogel with a three-dimensional porous structure significantly enhanced drug loading and enabled a staged release of MTO. First, a large amount of MTO was released from the hydrogel, and BP-based photothermal therapy (PTT) can cause rapid ablation of local tumors. Second, the sustained release of MTO from BP has a long-term inhibitory effect against tumor growth. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirmed that BP-PEG-MTO/MTO@Gel in the presence of PTT significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect on tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth. The strategy uses an injectable hydrogel to combine chemotherapy and PTT with stepwise drug release on local tumors, showing a promising pathway for cancer therapy.

Information Needs and Preferences of Men With Breast Cancer: A Qualitative Analysis of Internet Forum Posts.	"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sex-/gender-specific health information for men with breast cancer is lacking. Health information supports patients in shared decision-making. When developing evidence-based health information, it is important to identify the patients' information needs and preferences with regard to age, sex or gender, and other diversity aspects, including how the content is provided for the target group. However, studies show that sex/gender differences have rarely been considered. Our study investigates the information needs and preferences of cisgender men with breast cancer. METHODS: A content-structuring, qualitative content analysis of forum posts was performed. Internet forums and posts were selected according to the following criteria: relevance of the topic, English or German language, and public availability without registration. A qualitative content analysis according to Kuckartz was conducted. The selected posts were coded using MAXQDA. RESULTS: A total of 1025 posts from three Internet forums were screened, and 96 posts were included for analysis-most of them from a German Internet forum. We identified seven main categories and 26 subcategories. Information needs and preferences are represented by the following main categories: ""Epidemiology and general questions about the disease,"" ""Diagnostics,"" ""Therapy,"" ""Physician specialist services,"" ""Rehabilitation and lifestyle adaption,"" and ""Mental health."" Additionally, the ""Preference for and access to current information"" plays a role for the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the information needs and preferences of men with breast cancer, mainly from German-speaking countries. Providing accurate and reliable health information that meets patients' needs and preferences is an ethical duty and has to be provided by healthcare systems. Such patient-centered and inclusive health care will empower patients to make informed decisions."	The breast journal	2026	['Schemmel N', 'Lauberger J', 'Luhnen J', 'Steckelberg A']	41524023
The Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Depressive Symptoms and Their Relationship to Interoceptive Awareness: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in treating depression, enhancing interoceptive awareness (IA), and whether IA mediates this relationship. METHODS: In August 2024, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in web-based medical and psychological databases, including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies were included if they were quantitative, peer-reviewed, in English, used MBIs derived from Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), or Mindfulness-integrated Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (MiCBT), included a control/comparison group, pre- and post-intervention measures, assessed depressive symptoms and IA in adults over 18, and had at least 20 participants. Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, dissertations, case studies, qualitative research, therapies not derived from the specified MBIs, and studies with under 20 participants or individuals under 18. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. RESULTS: Six studies involving 646 participants met the inclusion criteria. All MBIs (MBCT, MBSR, MiCBT, Mindfulness-based Cancer Recovery, and Mindful Awareness in Body-Oriented Therapy) significantly reduced depressive symptomology and improved IA across varying effect sizes, with IA identified as a partial mediator. CONCLUSIONS: MBIs appear to alleviate depressive symptoms and improve IA, with one study finding IA as a mediator. Limitations included limited literature, search term specificity, heterogeneity and mixed evidence quality. Future research should explore IA's mediating role, develop a standardised IA measure, and integrate IA into broader treatment modalities to enhance outcomes.

Survivorship Issues in Older Adults with Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The number of older adult breast cancer survivors is increasing. This growing demographic comprises both women diagnosed with breast cancer when they are 65 years or older as well as women diagnosed in younger adulthood who then survive to elderhood. Older adult breast cancer survivors face unique challenges, including possible increased baseline comorbidity, symptom burden and a greater propensity to experience functional and cognitive decline after treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: This review outlines survivorship concerns affecting older adults with a history of breast cancer, including osteoporosis, increased risks of hip fractures, and worsened survival associated with the development of comorbidity. The review also acknowledges the existing interventions to identify and mitigate survivorship concerns of older adults including comprehensive geriatric assessments. SUMMARY: Highlighting the unique needs of this population may better inform treatment decision-making at the time of diagnosis and identify opportunities for future investigation in this realm.

Perineal Verrucous Carcinoma Associated With Hypercalcemia: First Clinical Report of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein-producing Tumor.	Cancer-related hypercalcemia typically indicates poor prognosis and occurs most commonly in squamous cell carcinoma cases. However, its occurrence in patients with verrucous carcinoma, a clinically indolent subtype, has never been reported. We present the first documented case of verrucous carcinoma-related hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) production. A 49-year-old man presented with weight loss, fatigue, and severe hypercalcemia. He had a 3-year history of a scrotal mass that was diagnosed as perineal verrucous carcinoma based on histopathologic examination. Laboratory results revealed markedly elevated calcium (13.0 mg/dL) and PTHrP (6.6 pmol/L) levels, confirming tumor-associated hypercalcemia. The cauliflower-like tumor measuring 17 x 15 cm involved the penis and scrotum. Complete surgical resection with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection was performed. Split-thickness skin grafts provided wound coverage over the large perineal defect. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed PTHrP production by tumor cells that had invaded beyond the basement membrane. Postoperative calcium (9.8 mg/dL) and PTHrP (<1.1 pmol/L) levels normalized rapidly. Histopathology confirmed verrucous carcinoma with dermal invasion; however, no lymph node metastasis occurred. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection developed but resolved with topical treatment. Six-month follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no recurrence with sustained hypercalcemia resolution. This first documented case linking PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia to verrucous carcinoma demonstrates that paraneoplastic hypercalcemia can occur in this typically indolent malignancy when dermal invasion occurs. Recognition of this rare syndrome is crucial for optimal management. Complete surgical excision achieved both oncological control and resolution of systemic complications, highlighting the importance of aggressive treatment when basement membrane invasion is present.

Integrated Multiomics Analysis Reveals a Migrasome-Related Signature for Prognosis and Immunotherapy Response in Lung Adenocarcinoma.	"BACKGROUND: Migrasomes, a newly identified subtype of extracellular vesicles generated during cell migration, play crucial roles in tumor microenvironment modulation. However, their systematic characterization in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unexplored. This study is aimed at deciphering migrasome-related molecular features and their clinical significance through multiomics integration. METHODS: We integrated bulk transcriptomes (541 LUAD samples from TCGA/GEO) with single-cell RNA-seq (GSE156632). Migrasome-related genes (MIGgenes) were identified through WGCNA and differential expression analysis. A machine learning framework incorporating 10 algorithms generated 101 combinatorial models, with the optimal prognostic signature (MIGsig) selected via 10-fold cross-validation. Biological mechanisms were investigated through ssGSEA, TME analysis, and in vitro validation. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed significant migrasome activity enrichment in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, with 115 cross-omics MIGgenes identified including 31 prognostic markers. The Lasso-Cox-derived 3-gene signature (GSTM5/DNASE1L3/PDGFB) demonstrated robust predictive performance (training set C index = 0.703; validation set GSE50081 AUC = 0.678). The low-MIGsig group exhibited characteristic ""hot tumor"" features, including elevated immune infiltration and higher tumor mutational burden, and significantly improved immunotherapy response rates in the IMvigor210 cohort. Finally, MIGsig-related genes were further validated by in vitro experiments and public database. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the first migrasome-based prognostic model for LUAD, demonstrating both independent survival prediction capability and clinical utility for identifying immunotherapy beneficiaries. The MIGsig signature provides novel biological insights into migrasome-mediated tumor-immune interactions and represents a promising tool for precision oncology applications in LUAD management."

Itaconate-Related Gene Signatures as Prognostic Markers in Colon Cancer: Insights From Transcriptomic and Spatial Analysis.	Colon cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors. Accurate evaluation of patient prognosis and optimization of treatment strategies continue to be major research focuses in colon cancer. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, this study is the first to comprehensively analyze the expression, biological roles, and prognosis of itaconate and Hallmark pathway-related genes in colon cancer using bulk transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial transcriptomics data. Through strict screening in 448 colon cancer patients from TCGA database (training set) and 7 colon cancer prognostic models from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (including 1473 cases in the validation set), 10 prognosis-related genes (TIMP1, FJX1, CD36, CXCL1, ETS2, CDKN2A, INHBB, PLEC, TUBB2, and P4HA1) were selected. The optimal prognostic prediction model (Enet [alpha = 0.2]) was constructed and validated, which showed good prognostic predictive value in both the training and validation sets (average C-index > 0.7) and was superior to previous conventional clinical features and 22 prognostic models developed by researchers in the past 4 years. ScRNAseq (GSE225857) and spatial transcriptomics analyses clarified the cell-specific expression and spatial distribution characteristics of these genes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), with high functional scores mainly enriched in epithelial and stromal cells. Tissue microarray (TMA) showed that the high-risk group had higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and higher expression of immune checkpoint genes, suggesting higher sensitivity to immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis identified four potentially effective drugs, such as sepantronium bromide, which had better effects on high-risk patients. This study provides a theoretical basis and new targets for precise prognosis and stratified treatment of colon cancer.

De-escalation of axillary surgery after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer: long-term outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone versus complete axillary lymph node dissection.	BACKGROUND: The optimal management of axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in breast cancer remains controversial. The oncological outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after NST are not well established. OBJECTIVE: This study comprehensively evaluated the long-term outcomes of SLNB alone versus ALND following NST in breast cancer patients achieving ycN0 status. DESIGN: A retrospective, multicenter, real-world study. METHODS: Patients initially presenting with clinically node-negative (cN0) or clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer who remained or converted to ycN0 after NST (2011-2022) were included. Patients were divided into SLNB-alone and ALND groups. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included recurrence rates, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1381 patients were included: 461 received SLNB alone, and 920 underwent ALND. Median follow-up was 34.2 months (range: 1.2-142.6 months). Local (2.8% vs 3.3%, p = 0.656) and regional (2.0% vs 1.3%, p = 0.353) recurrence rates were comparable between SLNB and ALND groups; distant metastases occurred in 5.6% versus 8.5% (p = 0.059). No significant differences in DFS, OS, LRFS, RRFS, or DMFS were observed between the SLNB-alone and ALND groups after IPTW adjustment. Subgroup analyses confirmed similar DFS or OS between the two surgical approaches across initial cN0 and cN+ subgroups; however, patients with initial cN2-3 disease exhibited inferior LRFS with SLNB alone. CONCLUSION: SLNB alone achieves oncologic outcomes comparable to ALND in ycN0 breast cancer patients after NST, regardless of initial nodal status, with caution warranted in initial cN2-3 disease. This suggests that SLNB alone can safely substitute ALND without compromising oncologic outcomes in appropriately selected patients.

Nephrotoxicity secondary to CDK 4/6 inhibitors in advanced breast cancer patients and its impact on survival.	BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have become a cornerstone in the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. While their efficacy is well-established, emerging reports of nephrotoxicity warrant further investigation into its incidence, risk factors, and potential impact on survival outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for nephrotoxicity in patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib or ribociclib) and to analyze its association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). DESIGN: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 120 patients with advanced breast cancer treated with palbociclib or ribociclib between October 2018 and July 2024. Nephrotoxicity was defined as a ⩾20% decline in creatinine clearance (CKD-EPI 2021) from baseline. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox regression models. RESULTS: Nephrotoxicity occurred in 28 patients (23.3%). Older age (⩾65 years) and higher baseline urea and creatinine levels were significant risk factors (p < 0.001). Paradoxically, patients who developed nephrotoxicity showed a trend toward better survival outcomes: median PFS was 30 months versus 20 months (p = 0.188), and the 3-year OS rate was 77.9% versus 63.8% (p = 0.801), though these differences were not statistically significant. In multivariate Cox analysis, the development of nephrotoxicity showed a trend toward a 71% reduction in mortality risk (HR = 0.293, p = 0.078), but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Nephrotoxicity is relatively common in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, particularly in older individuals and those with elevated baseline renal parameters. Contrary to conventional expectations, its occurrence may be associated with a trend toward improved survival, possibly reflecting higher drug exposure or effective target inhibition. These findings highlight the need for careful renal monitoring and suggest that nephrotoxicity could serve as a potential surrogate marker for treatment efficacy, warranting validation in larger prospective studies.

Cancer-derived inflammation is associated with bevacizumab resistance and inferior clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-derived inflammation has been shown to attenuate the efficacy of chemotherapy (CT) in colorectal cancer. However, its role in clinical response to bevacizumab (Bev) remains unclear in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical significance of the fibrinogen-to-prealbumin ratio (FPR) as a biomarker in mCRC patients receiving first-line Bev plus CT (Bev/CT). DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center, observational study. METHODS: Patients treated with first-line Bev/CT were enrolled across discovery (n = 249), internal validation (n = 115), and external validation (n = 109) cohorts, along with a patient group receiving CT alone (n = 175). Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics between the Bev/CT- and CT-treated groups. The primary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS), and 1-year overall survival (OS) was designated as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Elevated pretreatment FPR was significantly associated with increased tumor burden. FPR-H patients exhibited an unfavorable DCR compared to the FPR-L patients in the overall Bev/CT-treated population (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-3.61, p < 0.01). FPR-H was also independently associated with shorter PFS in the discovery (p (log-rank) < 0.01, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.11-2.05), internal validation (p (log-rank) < 0.01, adjusted HR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.43-4.27), and external validation cohorts (p (log-rank) < 0.001, adjusted HR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.43-3.64), regardless of KRAS status, particularly in the microsatellite stable subgroup. Furthermore, FPR-H patients had significantly worse 1-year OS than the FPR-L subgroup in the overall population (p (log-rank) < 0.001; adjusted HR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.78-4.61). Dynamic monitoring of FPR demonstrated utility in tracking disease progression during Bev/CT treatment, with earlier detection capability compared to imaging-based assessment. In propensity score-matched analysis, patients receiving Bev/CT showed superior outcomes relative to those receiving CT alone (p (log-rank) < 0.001), especially among the FPR-L subgroup (p (log-rank) < 0.01). In addition, Bev/oxaliplatin-treated FPR-L cases achieved better outcomes than those receiving the Bev/irinotecan regimen, particularly in the subgroup undergoing palliative resection. CONCLUSION: Cancer-derived inflammation appears to play a crucial role in mediating both intrinsic and acquired resistance to Bev. The FPR emerges as a robust, independent biomarker for predicting response to Bev, monitoring disease progression, and informing personalized therapeutic decision-making in patients with mCRC.

A Case Report of Non-Neutralizing Acquired Factor V Inhibitor Mimicking Deficiency: Diagnostic Challenges and Therapeutic Implications.	Acquired Factor V (FV) deficiency due to inhibitors is a rare coagulopathy that presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the case of an 81-year-old male with persistent gross hematuria and severe coagulopathy, marked by prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and critically low FV activity (< 1%). Initial mixing studies corrected the coagulation abnormalities, suggesting a deficiency rather than an inhibitor; however, standard therapies failed. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) did not elevate FV levels, and recombinant activated Factor VII (rFVIIa) did not resolve his symptoms, raising suspicion for a non-neutralizing inhibitor that depletes FV by increasing clearance. Clinical improvement was achieved with platelet transfusions, and his FV level normalized after treatment with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). PT and aPTT improved from 60 and > 200 to 12 and 32, respectively. It has remained normal with subsequent maintenance immunosuppression with rituximab. This case illustrates the diagnostic complexity created by non-neutralizing FV inhibitors, which accelerate factor clearance without directly impairing activity. It highlights the critical need for integrating clinical and laboratory findings to guide tailored treatment in managing rare coagulopathies.

Establishing a Consensus Algorithm for H. Pylori Screening, Diagnosis, Initial Management, and Referral Protocols for Primary Care Physicians.	BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a significant public health concern, contributing to various gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. The infection is highly prevalent in Africa, but still diagnostic and treatment challenges persist in primary care settings. Effective treatment regimens are therefore crucial for eradicating this infection and preventing complications. This study aimed to develop a consensus-based algorithm for H. pylori management optimized for Primary care settings utilizing data from primary care physicians, patient screening, and treatments. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted among forty-four primary care physicians involved in diagnosing and treating H. pylori infection. They were provided with a data Collection Form (DCF) and an H. pylori rapid antibody test kit. All the questionnaire responses and the result of rapid antibody test were recorded and analyzed. A panel of experts involving senior family medicine doctors, and a gastroenterologist via a modified Delphi process of discussions on the DCF responses, and test results from the 44 physicians arrived at a consensus-based treatment algorithm developed to guide clinical decision-making for H. pylori management. RESULTS: This study comprised 245 patients with a female preponderance and mean age of 35.0+/-11.5 years. The most common symptoms from the DCF were epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting and bloating in 74.5%, 52.7% and 35% respectively while the mean duration of symptoms was 3weeks. Constipation and irritability were the least common symptoms with heartburn reported less frequently in the H. Pylori positive cases. 79.9% of the 245 patients were H. Pylori treatment naive with a higher likelihood (57.1%) of having a positive antibody test. It was recommended that both treatment experienced and naive patients with epigastric or abdominal pain, nausea vomiting and/or bloating with symptom duration > 2weeks be tested and eradicated while those with alarm symptoms be referred to the specialist. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm provides a comprehensive guide for Physicians at the primary and secondary care level in selecting the most effective treatment regimen for H. pylori infection. H. Pylori antibody testing is a primary screening tool for patients with persistent symptoms or those lasting greater than 2weeks and where positive confirmatory test is recommended.

Factors associated with neoadjuvant therapy insensitivity and its prognostic impact in HER2-positive breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: A subset of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer shows insensitivity to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), often evidenced by imaging results indicating stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), which may reflect intrinsic resistance to treatment. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with NAT insensitivity and its prognostic value in HER2+ breast cancer. METHODS: This study included consecutive patients with HER2+ breast cancer who received NAT consisting of chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. NAT insensitivity was defined as SD or PD on the basis of treatment response evaluations. Statistical analyses were conducted on the collected clinical data, and HER2 heterogeneity was subsequently assessed. RESULTS: A total of 541 patients were included in the study, among whom 63 (11.6%) were categorized as NAT-insensitive group and 478 (88.4%) as NAT-sensitive group. Hormone receptor (HR) status (P=0.033), HER2 status (P=0.036) and anti-HER2 therapy (P=0.007) were associated with NAT sensitivity. NAT-insensitive group had a significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) (3-year: 69.4% vs. 94.3%; P<0.001) and remained an independent prognostic factor according to Cox models [hazard ratio (HR)=8.637; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.091-24.136; P<0.001]. Exploratory analysis revealed a greater proportion of HER2 heterogeneity in the NAT-insensitive group (19.4% vs. 4.3%; P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: HR positivity, HER2 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ status, and trastuzumab monotherapy are associated with NAT insensitivity, and NAT insensitivity independently indicates poor EFS. This study also highlights the need for prospective studies to clarify the role of HER2 heterogeneity and other mechanisms involved in predicting the response to NAT.

Development and validation of a clinical risk-prediction model for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in patients with gastrointestinal cancer based on four machine learning algorithms.	OBJECTIVE: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICIP) is a common and potentially life-threatening adverse event with non-specific symptoms. It is of significance to identify high-risk population of ICIP. However, existing prediction models for ICIP are often limited by their reliance on clinically inaccessible variables and homogeneous methodologies, hindering their clinical utility. This study aimed to develop a clinical risk-prediction model for ICIP in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer based on four machine learning (ML) methods. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from GI cancer patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) between 2018 and 2022 in Beijing Cancer Hospital. For each patient, 36 clinical indicators associated with pneumonia risk were gathered. The dataset was split into training and testing sets in a ratio of 7:3. Variable selection was first performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Subsequently, four ML algorithms: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Support vector machine (SVM), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), were employed to develop and validate ICIP prediction models. The models' performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. The optimal cutoff point for the best model was determined and a web-based tool was developed based on it. RESULTS: We collected medical data from 1,101 GI cancer patients. Ten predictive variables were identified as significant: gender, age, treatment line, smoking index, drinking history, lung metastasis, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, and albumin. After constructing and comparing four ML models, the RF model demonstrated best performance with an AUC of 0.899. The web-based tool for ICIP risk prediction is available at https://healthy.aistarfish.com/business/pneumonia-prediction/#/home. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed 36 clinical predictors of ICIP in 1,101 patients treated with ICIs, and 10 variables were included. The smoking index, albumin and hemoglobin emerged as novel predictors specific to GI cancers. Among the models constructed using four ML methods, the RF model showed the best performance. Additionally, a web-based tool was developed to facilitate the early clinical identification of populations at high risk of ICIP. Future directions include external validation of the model to enhance clinical usability.

Evolving diagnostic and surveillance strategies in esophageal cancer screening: Evidence from population-based studies in China.	Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common malignancies in China, accounting for over half of the world's new cases and deaths, and posing a severe threat to national health. Currently, the prevention and control of EC primarily rely on secondary prevention through screening, early diagnosis and early treatment to reduce EC-specific mortality. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with Lugol's iodine or optical staining followed by histopathological diagnosis of biopsy samples, serves as the gold standard for EC screening and has been widely implemented in numerous national public health programs for early cancer detection and treatment. Nevertheless, traditional pathology-centered diagnostic and surveillance strategies face significant challenges in current screening practices. Relying on large-scale population-based screening cohorts, including the Efficacy of Endoscopic Screening for Esophageal Cancer in China (ESECC) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01688908), a series of investigations into the diagnosis and surveillance of EC screening provided critical new insights and evidence for optimizing endoscopic screening strategies for EC in China. Summarizing relevant research findings from the above investigations, this article provides a systematic review of the epidemiology, current screening diagnostic and surveillance strategies, existing challenges, and key innovations related to EC. These insights offer valuable guidance for public health practice and clinical decision-making in the prevention and screening of EC and other cancers.

Epidemiology, early detection, and management of breast cancer in China: A comprehensive review.	Breast cancer represents a significant and growing public health challenge in China, marked by a rising incidence and distinct variations across age groups and geographical regions. This review synthesizes recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, early detection, and early treatment in the Chinese context. We outline current patterns of disease burden and the spectrum of risk factors-both modifiable and non-modifiable. We note ongoing shifts linked to reproductive trends, lifestyle changes, and an aging population. Screening practices are increasingly evolving towards stratified, risk-adapted pathways. These approaches often combine mammography with adjunct imaging modalities such as ultrasound, digital breast tomosynthesis, or magnetic resonance imaging for selected populations, while artificial intelligence is under active investigation to enhance image interpretation and streamline workflow. Contemporary early management strategies emphasize breast-conserving surgery and selective axillary surgery, alongside the expanded application of hypofractionated and precision-targeted radiotherapy. Systemic therapy is increasingly guided by tumor subtype. In the adjuvant setting, molecular profiling and multigene assays are now routinely utilized to tailor treatment intensity to individual tumor biology, facilitating both treatment escalation or de-escalation where appropriate. Concurrently, in the neoadjuvant setting, research efforts within China and globally are focused on evaluating novel therapeutic regimens and biomarker-driven strategies to improve pathologic complete response rates and inform subsequent postoperative care. A consolidated understanding of these evolving themes is crucial for shaping effective clinical practice and health policies, ultimately supporting the goals of earlier diagnosis and improved patient outcomes in China.

A multicenter study of a predictive model for pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer using multimodal digital biomarkers.	OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has become the standard treatment option for patients with locally advanced breast cancer. How to non-invasively screen out patients with pathological complete response (pCR) after NAT has become an urgent world-wide clinical problem. Our work aims to the assessment of neoadjuvant treatment response in breast cancer patients for higher accuracy prediction using innovative artificial intelligence system. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected longitudinal (pre-NAT and post-NAT) multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinicopathologic data of a total of 1,315 breast cancer patients (clinical stage I-III) who had undergone NAT followed by standard surgery and treated across 5 independent medical centers from January 2010 to January 2023. We used radiomics, 3D convolutional neural network technology and clinical data statistical analysis methods to extract and screen multimodal features, and then developed and validated a Clinical-Radiomics-Deep-Learning (CRDL) model to predict patients' pCR outcomes based on multimodal fusion features. RESULTS: We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the primary cohort (PC) and 3 external validation cohorts (VC(1-3)) to evaluate the model performance. The results showed that the AUC in the PC composed of 2 medical centers was 0.947 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.931-0.960], and the AUC values in VC(1-3) were 0.857 (95% CI: 0.810-0.901), 0.883 (95% CI: 0.841-0.918) and 0.904 (95% CI: 0.860-0.941), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CRDL model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting pCR to NAT using multimodal fusion data. This study provides a strong foundation for non-invasive assessment of pCR status in breast cancer patients following NAT and offers critical insights to guide clinical decision-making in post-NAT treatment planning.

Leukemia epidemiology in China: Burden, trends, and determinants in the 21st century.	This comprehensive review integrates population-based registries, hospital databases and Global Burden of Disease data to describe the evolving leukemia burden in China from 2000 to 2022. The overall incidence has stabilized nationally, but the absolute number of cases continues to increase as the population ages. A bimodal age pattern persists, with acute leukemias clustering in young children and older adults, while chronic forms predominate in mid-to-late life, and males are consistently more affected by all subtypes. Rapid expansion of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has resulted in marked survival gains for both acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and its seamless integration with molecularly targeted agents, venetoclax-based regimens and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has transformed acute leukemias into potentially curable diseases for an expanding proportion of patients. In parallel, universal access to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and standardized molecular monitoring have turned chronic myeloid leukemia into a manageable chronic condition, and survival of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is improving as novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase and BCL-2 inhibitors diffuse into clinical practice. Tobacco, obesity, benzene and radon remain the principal modifiable drivers of leukemogenesis. Strengthening data completeness, widening equitable access to precision therapies and controlling these environmental risks are essential to sustaining the observed continuous improvement in leukemia patient survival and ensuring that ever more Chinese patients achieve a cure or durable disease control in the decades ahead.

Curcumol overcomes cisplatin resistance and rewires glycolysis-H3K9la-ORC6 axis to trigger ferroptosis in bladder cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a cornerstone for bladder cancer treatment, but the development of resistance remains a major clinical challenge. Curcumol, a bioactive sesquiterpenoid derived from Curcumae Rhizoma, has shown anti-tumor potential. This study investigated the efficacy of curcumol in overcoming cisplatin resistance and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanisms in bladder cancer progression. METHODS: Clinical correlation was assessed in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without Curcumae Rhizoma. The anti-tumor effects of curcumol were evaluated in both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells. Multi-omics approaches, including RNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics, were employed. Key mechanisms involving H3K9 lactylation (H3K9la) were explored via Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assays. The role of the identified target ORC6 was validated through genetic knockout and overexpression. Finally, ferroptosis was confirmed by measuring lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)], total iron levels, and ferroptosis-related protein markers in vitro. RESULTS: Clinical data indicated that patients administered Curcumae Rhizoma exhibited enhanced responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, curcumol suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of both bladder cancer cells and cisplatin-resistant cells. Mechanistically, proteomic analysis and non-targeted metabolomics revealed that curcumol suppresses glycolysis and lactate production. Subsequently, Western blotting analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in H3K9la levels in both T24 and 5637 cells following curcumol treatment. This decrease in H3K9la was also observed in patient tumor tissues via immunohistochemistry staining. CUT&Tag analysis identified that H3K9la is enriched with the highest number of reads at the ORC6 promoter region. Combined in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that OCR6 exerted a tumor-promoting effect on bladder cancer. Its knockout induced G0/G1 phase arrest and enhanced apoptosis, while its expression contributed to cancer progression by enhancing invasive and migratory capabilities. Furthermore, ORC6 overexpression correlated with ferroptosis scores and ferroptosis-related genes. In vitro, OCR6 knockout promoted ferroptosis via DNA damage, characterized by elevated MDA content, decreased expression of core ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4 and SLC7A11), increased percentage of gammaH2AX-positive cells and longer DNA tails. Finally, we performed rescue experiments using a ferroptosis inhibitor in ORC6 knockout cells, which indicated that ferroptosis inhibitor could weaken the effect of ORC6 knockout on the invasive, migratory, and proliferative capacities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that curcumol effectively counteracted cisplatin resistance and inhibited bladder cancer progression by targeting the glycolysis-H3K9la-ORC6 axis to induce ferroptosis. This study established a critical link between metabolic reprogramming, histone lactylation, and ferroptosis, providing a novel therapeutic avenue for treating chemoresistant bladder cancer.

Flavonoids extract from Vitex negundo inhibit autophagy by targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/ULK signaling cascade in cancerous cells.	Vitex negundo (V. negundo), an Indian herb with a rich historical background for the handling of various complaints, is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by small trees with pale gray bark. This herb is widely used and has been recognized in traditional medicine for its pharmacological effects on a wide range of diseases. All sections of the plant, but particularly the leaves, contain a variety of secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, glycoside iridoids, tannins, and terpenes. The system is included in a number of store-bought herbal preparations and has the potential to function as an efficient bio-committee. Cancer continues to be a major cause of death and morbidity in spite of the intervention. One of the leading causes of death is cancer, and current therapies can have unpleasant side effects. Unhindered reactions, resistance to traditional cancer medications, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and restricted access to tumor tissue are some of the reasons why treatment frequently fails. To reduce side effects, increase chemotherapy sensitivity, and slow the spread of cancer, new approaches are required. Small food molecules have been suggested in numerous research as supplemental therapies for cancer patients. The effectiveness of the flavonoid-rich V. negundo extract in treating cancer was assessed mechanically in this investigation. Total flavonoids have been isolated for qualitative phytochemical investigation using V. negundo ethanolic extract. This article highlights significant developments in this field and explores how flavonoids contribute to the targeted suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in different cancer types.

Circulating microRNAs and serum proteins in breast cancer patients: Diagnostic relevance and grade-specific expression patterns.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a prominent contributor to female cancer-related mortality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential for effective management. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic relevance of a panel of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) independently or in combination with other tumor biomarkers and evaluate their sensitivity and specificity in classifying breast cancer patients by grade. METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed the aberrant expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-1246, miR-145, and miR-382, in addition to the tumor biomarkers cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in breast cancer patients with varying grades. RESULTS: Our results revealed distinct expression patterns of these miRNAs between grade II and III patients. Specifically, miR-21, miR-221, and miR-1246 were significantly elevated, while miR-145 and miR-382 were downregulated. Elevated serum levels of CA15-3 and 8-OHdG were observed in breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, with CA15-3 showing greater diagnostic efficacy in differentiating between grades. Our study revealed strong correlations among evaluated miRNAs, suggesting their interconnected roles in breast cancer progression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for all investigated miRNAs, with miR-21 and miR-1246 showing the highest diagnostic power for differentiating patients from healthy individuals and distinguishing breast cancer grades. Moreover, the combination of multiple miRNAs and conventional tumor biomarkers revealed enhanced diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that circulating miRNAs may play a significant role in distinguishing breast cancer patients based on tumor grade, with superior diagnostic performance over some tumor biomarkers, supporting the development of multi-analyte liquid biopsy approaches in the diagnostic process and personalized management of breast cancer patients.

Relationship of diabetes mellitus with prognostic factors in breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes can lead to organ failure unless properly controlled, and it is associated with numerous health issues, particularly metabolic problems. Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in females worldwide and represents a major health concern due to its morbidity and mortality. The progression of the disease and the response to treatment depend on numerous variables, including both tumor biology and patient-related factors. Key prognostic indicators include age, tumor size, lymph node involvement, histological type, hormone receptor status, and expression of biomarkers such as HER2. AIM: To investigate the relationship between preoperative blood glucose levels and cancer prognostic factors in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: In this study patients diagnosed with breast cancer were classified into two groups: Those with blood glucose levels < 125 mg/dL and those with levels > 125 mg/dL. Estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity, Ki-67 percentage, Cerb2 positivity, number of positive lymph nodes, and presence of lymphovascular invasion were examined histopathologically. RESULTS: The study included 246 patients with breast cancer: 196 were in the normal glucose group and 50 were in the elevated glucose group. In the normal glucose group, 68% of the tumors were left-sided and 32% were right-sided, while all tumors in the elevated glucose group were left-sided. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Tumor size, Ki-67, and the number of positive lymph nodes were not associated with blood glucose in patients with breast cancer (P > 0.05 for all). However, blood glucose was correlated with age in this population. Correlation analyses revealed that blood glucose was positively correlated with age (r = 0.23, P < 0.001). Additionally, Ki-67 was correlated with tumor size (r = 0.14, P = 0.03) and age (r = -0.18, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted the complex interplay between metabolic factors, such as fasting glucose levels, and breast cancer characteristics. Elevated glucose levels were associated with older age. The significant association between tumor laterality and glucose levels underscores the need for further investigation into the collective influence of metabolic and anatomical factors on breast cancer development and progression.

Pembrolizumab-Induced Colitis With Concurrent Capecitabine in Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma: A Case Report.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but their use is associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Colitis is a significant irAE, particularly with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors like pembrolizumab. This case report details a 48-year-old female with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who developed colitis while on pembrolizumab and capecitabine. The patient presented with symptoms including diarrhea and stomatitis, which were initially managed with supportive care. Subsequent investigation with colonoscopy was normal appearing; however, biopsy revealed mild focal active colitis microscopically. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and management of pembrolizumab-induced colitis, especially in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, and emphasizes the need to differentiate it from other gastrointestinal issues or other drug-induced colitis, such as that caused by capecitabine. This case also adds evidence to help guide early histological identification of ICI-induced colitis, and a comprehensive literature review on pembrolizumab-induced colitis is presented, discussing its incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies.

BAF-UNet: a boundary-aware segmentation model for skin lesion segmentation.	PURPOSE: Skin lesion segmentation plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. Accurate skin lesion segmentation is essential for skin cancer diagnosis and treatment but is challenged by ambiguous boundaries and diverse lesion shapes and sizes. We aim to improve segmentation performance with enhanced boundary preservation. APPROACH: We propose BAF-UNet, a boundary-aware segmentation network. It integrates a multiscale boundary-aware feature fusion (BFF) module to combine low-level boundary features with high-level semantic information, and a boundary-aware vision transformer (BAViT) that incorporates boundary guidance into MobileViT to capture local and global context. A boundary-focused loss function is also introduced to prioritize edge accuracy during training. The model is evaluated on ISIC2016, ISIC2017, and PH2 datasets. RESULTS: Experiments demonstrate that BAF-UNet improves Dice scores and boundary accuracy compared to baseline models. The BFF and BAViT modules enhance boundary delineation while maintaining robustness across lesions of varying shapes and sizes. CONCLUSIONS: BAF-UNet effectively integrates boundary guidance into feature fusion and transformer-based context modeling, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, particularly along lesion edges, and shows potential for clinical application in automated skin cancer diagnosis.

Current Treatment Strategies for Diffuse Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor: A Review of the Literature.	BACKGROUND: Diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor (DTGCT) is a locally aggressive benign tumor of the synovium. Patients often initially present with pain, stiffness, and swelling of the affected joint with varying levels of severity. Treatment traditionally involved surgical resection exclusively; however, this could be complicated by high disease recurrence rates. New research has introduced several targeted systemic therapies onto the market changing the treatment paradigm and necessitating a multidisciplinary treatment approach in specialized centers to optimize patient outcomes. METHODS: This review synthesizes the current literature on DTGCT including its pathophysiology, classification, diagnosis, and available treatment options. There is a particular focus on the newer systemic therapies available and how these medications may be used in conjunction with surgery to enhance disease control. RESULTS: DTGCT most commonly affects young to middle-aged adults, with a slight female predominance, and is most frequently found in the knee. Arthroscopic and even open synovectomy can have disease recurrence rates exceeding 50%. Colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor inhibitors have proven effective at symptom palliation and reducing tumor burden in approximately 40% of patients. While these medications improve the quality of life for patients with unresectable disease, they may also be effective in the neoadjuvant setting to downstage surgical approaches and possibly improve disease control in otherwise highly morbid cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery alone, the traditional standard for DTGCT, is often insufficient due to high recurrence rates. Systemic therapies can restore function and improve quality of life in patients with advanced disease with rare-but potentially serious-adverse effects. Combining surgical resection with neoadjuvant CSF1R inhibition may provide superior outcomes. Further research is needed to refine the role of systemic agents and develop multidisciplinary protocols. Although initial symptoms often lead patients to community providers, optimal care for patients with DTGCT is best delivered at referral centers with dedicated musculoskeletal oncology programs.

Beyond synthetic lethality in large-scale metabolic and regulatory network models via genetic minimal intervention set.	MOTIVATION: The integration of genome-scale metabolic and regulatory networks has received significant interest in cancer systems biology. However, the identification of lethal genetic interventions in these integrated models remains challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of potential solutions. To address this, we developed the genetic Minimal Cut Set (gMCS) framework, which computes synthetic lethal interactions-minimal sets of gene knockouts that are lethal for cellular proliferation- in genome-scale metabolic networks with signed directed acyclic regulatory pathways. Here, we present a novel formulation to calculate genetic Minimal Intervention Sets, gMISs, which incorporate both gene knockouts and knock-ins. RESULTS: With our gMIS approach, we assessed the landscape of lethal genetic interactions in human cells, capturing interventions beyond synthetic lethality, including synthetic dosage lethality and tumor suppressor gene complexes. We applied the concept of synthetic dosage lethality to predict essential genes in cancer and demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity when compared to large-scale gene knockout screen data. We also analyzed tumor suppressors in cancer cell lines and identified lethal gene knock-in strategies. Finally, we demonstrate how gMISs can help uncover potential therapeutic targets, providing examples in hematological malignancies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The gMCSpy Python package now includes gMIS functionalities. Access: https://github.com/PlanesLab/gMCSpy.

Transient expression of human interleukin-15 in Nicotiana benthamiana.	A plant-based expression system provides a cost-effective, scalable, and safe alternative to traditional cell culture platforms. In this study, recombinant human interleukin-15 (IL-15) was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using agroinfiltration. IL-15 is a cytokine with significant potential in cell engineering, immunotherapy, and cancer therapy. A codon-optimized IL-15 gene was cloned into a binary vector designed for plant expression and introduced into Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens). The R. radiobacter for human IL-15 expression was infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Following purification, receptor-binding assays confirmed that the plant-derived IL-15 could bind to the IL-15 receptor comparably to its mammalian-produced counterpart. This first report of IL-15 expression in plants highlights the promise of plant-based systems for biopharmaceutical production and lays the groundwork for further development of IL-15 for applications in cell engineering, clinical therapies, and the cultured meat industry.

Short- and Long-term Outcomes After Laparoscopic Versus Open Total Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Total gastrectomy is the cornerstone treatment for gastric cancer, particularly in patients with proximal or large tumors. For early-stage gastric cancer, laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) has demonstrated comparable short- and long-term outcomes to those of open total gastrectomy (OTG), while reports on advanced gastric cancer (AGC) are limited. We aimed to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with AGC who underwent LTG or OTG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included consecutive patients with AGC who underwent LTG or OTG with lymph node dissection at our institution from January 2002 to June 2024. Propensity score matching was conducted at a 1:1 ratio to reduce bias. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were enrolled (LTG: 39; OTG: 119). Of these, 64 were paired by propensity score matching. The clinical tumor invasion depth was balanced, but the pathological depth was significantly deeper in the LTG group. The number of patients with lymph node metastasis did not differ. The median operative time was longer for LTG (512.5 min) than for OTG (267 min), whereas LTG resulted in significantly less blood loss (125 g vs. 411 g). Postoperative morbidity (>/=Clavien‒Dindo grade 3) was comparable (LTG: 12.5%, OTG: 9.4%). The LTG group had a significantly shorter median hospital stay (11 days vs. 17 days). There were no significant differences in overall or recurrence-free survival between the groups. CONCLUSION: LTG is a feasible and safe approach for AGC, offering comparable short- and long-term outcomes to OTG.

Robot-Assisted Sigmoidectomy in a Patient With Situs Inversus Totalis: A Case Report.	Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a complete mirror-image transposition of thoracic and abdominal organs. Surgery in such patients is technically challenging because of the reversed anatomy, and only a few cases of robot-assisted surgery (RS) for colon cancer in SIT have been reported. We report a rare case of robot-assisted sigmoidectomy with radical lymph node dissection for sigmoid colon cancer in a 31-year-old woman with SIT. The patient presented with abdominal pain and hematochezia, and was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer at a previous hospital. Further examination at our institution confirmed SIT, and a robot-assisted sigmoidectomy was successfully performed with modified port placement to accommodate the mirrored anatomy. The procedure was completed safely, and the patient was discharged without complications. RS can be a safe and effective approach for patients with anatomical anomalies such as SIT.

Radiation-Induced Breast Sarcoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.	Radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) of the breast is a rare but serious late complication of radiotherapy, characterized by high-grade malignancy, rapid recurrence, and poor prognosis. Although rare, its incidence may increase due to improved survival rates among breast cancer patients. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman who developed a pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma in the irradiated field seven years after adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges, therapeutic considerations, and prognostic implications of this rare entity.

Histoblast: A Novel Cavitative High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)-Modified Technique for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent condition, often requiring intervention due to its impact on quality of life. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has demonstrated efficacy in prostate cancer treatment; however, its application in BPH remains limited by prolonged treatment times and delayed symptom relief. This report introduces a novel HIFU-based technique (Histoblast) using the Sonablate 500(R) (SB-500) system to improve treatment efficiency and clinical outcomes in BPH. Key modifications to the conventional HIFU approach include: (1) a checkerboard treatment pattern to reduce treatment time (TT) and tissue edema; (2) prostate compression via increased degassed water volume to minimize heat dissipation and enhance acoustic efficiency; and (3) optimized energy delivery within the upper third of the device's approved range. Treatment progress is monitored using standard safety parameters, including Tissue Change Monitoring and Reflectivity Index measurements. The procedure is performed under spinal anesthesia, with postoperative catheterization lasting approximately four days. This technique reduces the number of treatment shots by 40-50%, achieving a significantly shorter TT. Controlled acoustic cavitation is observed in up to 70-75% of treated zones, indicating effective tissue ablation. Preservation of the urethra and bladder neck is prioritized to facilitate early catheter removal. This technique represents a promising refinement of HIFU for BPH management and warrants further clinical evaluation.

A Rare Case of Parathyroid Carcinoma Initially Misdiagnosed as a Parathyroid Adenoma.	Parathyroid carcinoma is an uncommon endocrine malignancy that can resemble a benign parathyroid adenoma, typically presenting with hypercalcaemia and nonspecific symptoms that make preoperative diagnosis difficult. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman from Birmingham, United Kingdom, who presented with recurrent hypercalcaemia associated with body aches, lethargy, polydipsia, and voice changes. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated calcium and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Imaging studies identified a small left parathyroid lesion consistent with a functioning adenoma. The patient underwent left superior parathyroidectomy, with postoperative normalization of calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Histopathological examination unexpectedly revealed parathyroid carcinoma, confirmed by parafibromin immunohistochemistry and review by a second pathologist. Postoperative imaging showed no evidence of metastasis, and the patient remains asymptomatic with normal biochemical values during follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing parathyroid carcinoma from adenoma and emphasizes the importance of histopathological evaluation and multidisciplinary management.

Hysteroscopic Diagnosis of a Concurrent Placental Site Nodule and Cervical Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report.	A 32-year-old woman presented with atypical glandular cells on cervical cytology. Her obstetric history was gravida 2 para 2, with 23 months since her last pregnancy. Colposcopy and biopsy revealed cervical adenocarcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed no distant spread but suggested a uterine lesion, which was suspected to be corpus uterine cancer. Hysteroscopy revealed a 15-mm white nodular lesion in the lower uterine body; biopsy suggested a placental site nodule (PSN). Cervical conization confirmed stage IA2 cervical adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy. Final pathology showed no residual carcinoma. The uterine lesion was confirmed as benign PSN via immunohistochemistry. She remained recurrence-free at the two-year follow-up. This is the first reported case of concurrent PSN and cervical adenocarcinoma. Visualization and targeted biopsy allowed accurate diagnosis of PSN, preventing overtreatment. The case highlights the diagnostic value of hysteroscopy and the importance of histological evaluation to differentiate PSN from malignancy.

Hippocampal Atrophy Following Therapeutic Irradiation of Intracranial and Nasopharyngeal Tumors.	The review aims to summarize and evaluate existing data on macroscopic changes in hippocampal volume following therapeutic brain irradiation, with a focus on the patterns, dynamics, and modulating factors of this structural damage. This narrative review is based on a structured search of the PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) database and relevant bibliographies (2000-2025), selecting studies that applied MRI volumetry to assess hippocampal changes after radiotherapy. We summarized the results of studies using MRI volumetry in patients undergoing radiation therapy for central nervous system tumors and nasopharyngeal cancer. The analysis covered various irradiation methods, including local and whole-brain techniques, with a focus on dose-volume relationships, temporal dynamics, and differential vulnerability of subfields. The data indicate a marked, dose-dependent reduction in hippocampal volume following irradiation. The degree of atrophy, often reaching 5-9% in the early years, significantly exceeds normal age-related decline and may rival that seen in neurodegenerative pathologies. Certain subregions, particularly the dentate gyrus and CA1, show particular sensitivity. The temporal development of atrophy varies, showing both rapid initial loss followed by stabilization and progressive patterns. The pediatric population may show partial recovery of the growth trajectory, albeit with a reduced baseline. Critical factors influencing the degree of atrophy include patient age and, potentially, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while concurrent chemotherapy is often not a determining factor. Quantitative assessment of hippocampal volume change is a reliable and objective biomarker of radiation-induced neurotoxicity. This parameter is an important tool for refining hippocampal radiation dose constraints in radiation therapy planning and for functional assessment after treatment, highlighting the need to incorporate hippocampal protection strategies into modern neuro-oncology practice.

Diffuse Idiopathic Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia Mimicking Lung Cancer: A Case Report.	Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is an extremely uncommon and incompletely elucidated pulmonary condition arising from neuroendocrine cells within the airway epithelium. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented to our thoracic surgery department with a history of hemoptysis following the incidental discovery of a solitary pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe, highly suspicious for lung cancer. After a thorough diagnostic workup, including positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), our multidisciplinary team recommended a right middle lobectomy. The histopathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed DIPNECH without evidence of an associated carcinoid tumor. Given the potential for progression to neuroendocrine neoplasm, the development of evidence-based management protocols for DIPNECH remains essential. This case highlights the atypical and often silent presentation of this rare lung pathology and emphasizes the importance of considering DIPNECH in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules.

Pelvic Sepsis Secondary to Necrotic Coloanal Anastomosis After Perineal Proctosigmoidectomy Leading to Emergent Abdominoperineal Resection: A Rare Case and Complication.	Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is a surgical procedure that involves the complete removal of the anal canal, anal sphincter complex, rectum, and a portion of the sigmoid colon with creation of an end colostomy. This procedure is primarily indicated for patients with low rectal cancers where the anal sphincters cannot be spared and anal cancers refractory to chemoradiation or recurrent anal cancers. It can also be performed in patients with severe perianal Crohn's disease, complex anorectal fistulae, or patients with severe trauma to the anus/rectum where the sphincter complex is significantly affected. This is a complex procedure with a high complication rate, and patients generally undergo extensive perioperative planning and assessment to optimize a positive outcome. In this report, we describe a rare case of emergent APR in a patient who presented with pelvic sepsis secondary to necrotic rectum and colon after a prior emergent Altemeier procedure at another hospital. A thorough literature review has revealed only one prior documented case of emergent APR.	Cureus	2025 Dec	['Yerramilli P', 'Boysen M', 'Fioretti K', 'Stapler SJ']	41523482
Lymph Node Ratio: A Novel Prognostic Indicator for Gastric Cancer.	"Introduction Gastric cancer remains one of the most common malignancies and is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Accurate nodal staging is critical for gastric cancer prognosis but is often compromised by ""stage migration"" and variability in lymph node (LN) harvest inherent in the current AJCC N-staging system. The lymph node ratio (LNR) has emerged as a potentially more reliable prognostic indicator that accounts for the extent of lymphadenectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the LNR, determine an optimal cutoff value, and compare its accuracy against the conventional AJCC 8th edition N-stage in patients undergoing curative gastrectomy. Methods and materials This was a single-institution, retrospective cohort study. The study analyzed 85 patients with non-metastatic gastric cancer who underwent surgical treatment between January 2021 and December 2024. Clinicopathological data were collected, and the LNR was calculated and categorized into four groups: LNR1 (0%), LNR2 (1-25%), LNR3 (26-50%), and LNR4 (51-100%). Results The median overall survival (OS) was 26 months. Only 24.7% of patients had an optimal LN dissection (>15 nodes). A higher LNR was strongly associated with poorer survival, with median OS decreasing from 36 months in LNR1 to 17 months in LNR4. Multivariate analysis revealed that LNR was a significant independent prognostic factor for survival (p<0.001), whereas the conventional pN stage was not (p=0.098). Conclusions The LNR is a simple, robust, and independent prognostic indicator for overall survival in patients with gastric cancer, appearing superior to the conventional pN stage. Its use can improve risk stratification, particularly in cases of suboptimal lymphadenectomy."	Cureus	2025 Dec	['A APK', 'K C', 'P N S']	41523468
Outcomes of Free Flap Surgery in Head and Neck Cancer Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Single-Institution Retrospective Study of 61 Cases.	Introduction The number of head and neck cancer patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing. Although free flap reconstruction has become more feasible with advances in renal replacement therapy, perioperative risks in CKD remain uncertain. Prior reports are limited and inconclusive. We evaluated free flap outcomes in CKD patients undergoing head and neck reconstruction. Materials and methods We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of 61 patients with CKD, operationalized by preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within the presurgical window (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), who underwent free flap reconstruction (2011-2022). The primary outcome was flap complications (postoperative thrombosis requiring thrombectomy or flap necrosis). Failure cases underwent histopathologic review of anastomosed vessels. A prespecified descriptive comparison contrasted flap events by diabetes mellitus (DM) status. Statistical analysis used Fisher's exact test; owing to only five events, no multivariable models were fitted. Postoperative continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) use was recorded. Results The most common eGFR category was G3a (65.1%), followed by G3b, G5, and G4. Flap complications occurred in 5/61 (8.2%) patients: necrosis (3/61; 4.9%) and thrombosis salvaged by thrombectomy (2/61; 3.3%). All events arose in G3a; no events were seen in G3b-G5 or among CHDF cases. Histopathology showed severe occlusive change in one necrosis case (~80% luminal stenosis), while other failures had at most mild intimal thickening; two failures occurred without diabetes mellitus (DM)/cardiovascular disease or evident vascular pathology. DM was present in 14/61 (23%) patients; event proportion was 14.3% with DM vs. 6.4% without DM (Fisher p = 0.32), a non-significant difference consistent in direction with prior reports. Discussion Events were infrequent and clustered in G3a; the absence of events in higher categories is not interpretable, given very small subgroup sizes and limited power. Vascular pathology among failures was heterogeneous, indicating that overt vasculopathy or glycemic status alone does not fully explain failure. Careful perioperative management may support flap viability, but causal inference is unwarranted. Conclusion Free flap reconstruction appears feasible in selected CKD patients with optimized perioperative care; however, findings are hypothesis-generating and require confirmation in larger controlled cohorts with standardized operative reporting and adjustment for confounding.

Unmasking Hidden Clues in Cutaneous Viral Infections: Histopathological Insights Into Keratinocytic Features of Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus, and Molluscum Contagiosum.	"OBJECTIVE:  This case study aimed to explore primarily the keratinocytic changes of cutaneous viral infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and molluscum contagiosum (MC). The focus was on identifying features and diagnostic clues in cases without typical findings. METHODS:  A retrospective analysis encompassing 14 HSV/VZV cases (January 2000 to October 2023) and 22 MC cases (January 2013 to December 2015) was conducted. RESULTS:  In HSV/VZV cases, 71% (10 of 14) exhibited distinctive histopathological features in the adjacent keratinocytes, including nucleolar enlargement and atypical features. Immunohistochemical studies in 40% of the cases (4 of 10) revealed positive staining in cells with cytopathic changes and negative staining in adjacent atypical keratinocytes. Conversely, MC cases consistently demonstrate an enlarged, stuffed ""pregnant seahorse appearance"" of keratinocytes around molluscum bodies. CONCLUSION:  This study highlights the diagnostic significance of keratinocytic changes in these viral infections, allowing pathologists to perform additional studies to make the correct diagnosis in cases where typical viral changes are not readily apparent."

Acral Speckled Lentiginous Nevus.	"Speckled lentiginous nevus (SLN), also referred to as nevus spilus, is a common benign melanocytic neoplasm typically occurring as a small, cafe-au-lait-colored ""speckled"" patch studded with numerous darkly pigmented macules or papules. Herein, we present a unique case of SLN arising on the sole of the right foot in a young woman, which was reported to be gradually enlarging since a pregnancy two years prior. The lesion was removed by shave biopsy, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis and ruled out atypical features. While SLN is quite common, the occurrence on acral skin is extremely rare. SLN is considered a mosaic RASopathy due to its embryological development through a postzygotic activating HRAS genetic variant. Although small lesions usually remain isolated, underlying SLN syndrome should be considered in extensive cases with associated neurologic or musculoskeletal abnormalities. Secondary melanocytic neoplasms commonly arise within SLN, but overall, small lesions carry a low risk of malignant transformation, and prophylactic surgical treatment is not necessary. We briefly discuss SLN occurring in special sites and report this novel case with a review of the literature on SLN."

A Rare Case of Severe Disseminated Pyoderma Gangrenosum of the Upper Body With Concurrent Nasopharyngeal and Inferior Orbital Wall Necrosis.	Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis usually linked to autoimmune or inflammatory bowel disease and typically affects the lower extremities. This case is notable for extensive upper-body, oropharyngeal, and nasal involvement in a patient without an underlying autoimmune disorder. A 56-year-old man with chronic cocaine use and stage IV renal cell carcinoma presented with rapidly progressive ulcerations of the face, neck, shoulders, and back, along with nasal septal collapse and oropharyngeal destruction. Prior biopsy demonstrated sterile neutrophilic inflammation without vasculitis, infection, or malignant infiltration, supporting PG as a diagnosis of exclusion. Imaging showed erosive sinonasal disease. He was treated with systemic and topical corticosteroids and antibiotics for concurrent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, as well as MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound colonization. Cyclosporine was avoided because of his metastatic cancer, and both percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and parenteral nutrition were deferred due to infection risk and concern for pathergy. With limited therapeutic options and an advanced malignancy, care transitioned to comfort measures. This case illustrates the diagnostic difficulty of PG when cocaine exposure, malignancy, and mucosal destruction coexist. The absence of vasculitides or cytopenias, combined with biopsy findings, supported PG as the unifying diagnosis. Clinicians should consider PG in atypical facial or upper-body ulcerations and recognize how comorbid conditions may restrict standard treatment.

A Phase I Study of Nimotuzumab With Nivolumab in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Nimotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor. Nivolumab is an anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD1) mAb that overcomes immune checkpoint inhibition. This trial aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of combination treatment as second-line therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). METHODS: This was a single-center, single-arm, non-randomized study utilizing a three plus three dose escalation design. Nimotuzumab was given intravenously (IV) at escalating doses of 200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg after nivolumab infusion at 240 mg IV every two weeks in a 28-day cycle. Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were determined. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the trial. Serial EKG and troponin checks were performed. RESULTS: Seven patients were enrolled across the 200 mg and 300 mg nimotuzumab dose levels. The median age was 64.1 years. Four patients (57.1%) were males. Five (71.4%) had NSCLC, and the predominant histology was pure adenocarcinoma (n = 4, 57.1%). Four patients (57.1%) had Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation. All patients had disease progression after platinum-based and anti-PD1 therapy prior to enrollment, except for two NSCLC patients who were enrolled to receive this treatment after initial platinum-based chemotherapy only. Four patients (two from each dose level) had troponin elevation (median = 0.1 ng/ml, range = 0.07 to 0.3 ng/ml) lasting at least 24 hours, which normalized next week without any associated chest pain, except for one patient (HNSCC) with potential treatment-related DLT. Disease control rate was 42.9% (stable disease as best response, n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic troponin elevation was seen with this combination treatment. While there were no clinically significant adverse cardiac outcomes, further development was terminated due to the competitive landscape.

Atypical Chest Wall Cystic Hygroma in a Toddler: A Case Report and Comprehensive Review.	Lymphangiomas, also known as cystic hygromas, are rare benign lymphatic malformations that typically occur in the head and neck region. Breast or chest wall involvement in pediatric patients is exceptionally rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of a three-year-old boy who presented with a progressively enlarging right breast mass. Unsupervised topical creams and massage led to further enlargement. Laboratory investigations showed mild elevation in prolactin levels, which normalized after surgery. Ultrasonography demonstrated multiple cystic lesions, the largest of which was oval and measured 26 mm in diameter, along with an enlarged right axillary lymph node. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-defined oval mass (51 x 26 mm) in the right chest wall. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a complete histopathological examination was performed. Histopathological examination revealed multiple lymphatic spaces lined by flattened endothelial cells forming a tumorous mass, with both cavernous and capillary-type lumens. The diagnosis of lymphangioma was confirmed. No mammary tissue was detected, and cancer was excluded. Subsequent evaluations over one week indicated full recovery with normalized prolactin levels. This case underscores the necessity of including lymphangioma in the differential diagnosis of young chest wall tumors. Although this condition is uncommon, early detection and appropriate surgical intervention result in favorable outcomes with a low chance of recurrence.

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is caused by reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus in the sensory ganglia. It typically presents as painful grouped vesicles confined to one or two dermatomes. Most lesions resolve within two to four weeks; however, a subset of patients go on to develop postherpetic neuralgia in the area of the original zoster rash, characterized by allodynia and hyperalgesia lasting months or even years. The risk increases with age, immunosuppression, and underlying conditions such as cancer, kidney or liver disease, chronic lung disorders, etc. Although the use of oral antiviral medications during the early stages may reduce the severity and duration of acute herpes zoster, their effect on preventing postherpetic neuralgia remains limited. In this article, we report the case of a 75-year-old female with severe postherpetic neuralgia involving the left sciatic nerve distribution, with resulting motor paresis. After an extensive trial of various oral medication regimens and a lumbar epidural injection, which provided short-term relief, the patient underwent peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) implantation, with eventual favorable response. Our case report highlights the potential role of using PNS to treat severe postherpetic neuralgia refractory to mainstay conservative treatment modalities.

CT-Guided Percutaneous Cryoablation of a Renal Metastasis From Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.	Renal involvement in esophageal adenocarcinoma is an uncommon clinical finding. We describe the case of a 74-year-old man with stage IV esophageal adenocarcinoma and prior hepatic, retroperitoneal nodal, and cerebral metastases who developed a new hypermetabolic lesion in the left kidney on Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT). MRI identified a 3.4 cm enhancing mass, and biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. The lesion was treated with CT-guided cryoablation using a dual freeze-thaw protocol. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and a small upper-pole bleed identified immediately post-procedure was successfully managed with selective coil embolization. He resumed systemic therapy and remained asymptomatic at the four-week follow-up, with a complete metabolic response at the ablation site on the follow-up PET/CT. This case illustrates the feasibility of CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation as a minimally invasive option for local control of renal metastases in patients with esophageal cancer.

Characteristics of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in Children With Cancer and in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit: An Analysis of an AKI Registry From a Tertiary Cancer Center.	Objective Detection and tracing of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children with cancer in Jordan and the developing world are very limited. The objective of this paper is to report the incidence, the outcome, risk factors, as well as some clinical parameters associated with AKI in children with cancer. Methodology This study is based on an analysis of a registry that was established for children with cancer who develop AKI. The aim of the registry was to detect, trace, define risk factors, and maintain follow-up for children who develop AKI at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC). A flag system was established for all children who develop AKI. The pediatric department at KHCC is composed of four locations. These include the pediatric ward, bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and the emergency room (E/R). Analysis was done in all locations. AKI was defined and staged according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Results During the study period, there were 16,273 total hospital admissions, and the cancer registry included 4,482 unique patients. A total of 473 AKI attacks occurred, representing 2.9% of all admissions. These attacks occurred in 374 patients, indicating that 8.3% of cancer patients experienced at least one AKI episode. The mean follow-up duration was 2.27 +/- 1.28 years. In the pediatric ward, 134 attacks of AKI were recorded (1.1% of admissions; 5.7% of patients). In the BMT unit, 117 attacks of AKI were recorded (4.3% of admissions; 6.9% of patients). In the PICU, 74 attacks of AKI were recorded (4.4% of admissions; 10.8% of patients). The most common place of developing AKI for patients at KHCC was in the home setting (community acquired) as 148 (31.3%) of patients who had AKI presented to the E/R with AKI, 134 (28.3%) had AKI while in the ward, 117 (24.7%) patients while in the BMT unit, and 74 (15.6%) patients while in the ICU. Fifty-four (14.4%) patients had two attacks, 15 (4.0%) had three attacks, and five (1.3%) had more than three attacks of AKI. The maximum stage of AKI reached was stage 1 in 204 (43.1%) patients, stage 2 in 167 (35.3%) patients, and stage 3 in 102 (21.6%) patients. In the PICU stage, three was the most common maximum stage reached. The main cause of AKI at KHCC was nephrotoxic medications in 204 (43.1%) of patients. High-dose methotrexate (MTx) was the most common single drug to cause AKI in 34 (16.7%) patients. The most common cause for home-acquired AKI was pre-renal in 47 (32%) patients. The most common malignancy in children who developed AKI was hematological in 230 (48.6%) patients. Residual renal damage was detected following 66 (14%) patients. Another 38 (8%) patients passed away, suggesting a higher mortality in children who developed AKI than in children without AKI. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was done for 15 patients (3.2%), whereas 458 patients (96.8%) did not need RRT. Conclusion AKI in children with cancer shares many features with AKI in the general pediatric population, with multiple similar clinical manifestations. However, oncology patients have unique risk factors - most notably nephrotoxic chemotherapy, tumor lysis syndrome, sepsis, and obstructive uropathy - which distinguish their AKI profile. Variations between units within the same center can also influence AKI patterns. An in-center registry is therefore essential for early detection and ongoing monitoring of AKI cases.

Challenging Aspects of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis With Malignant Transformation: A Report of Two Cases.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the colon and rectum. Despite its rarity, data on FAP in Morocco remain limited due to the absence of a national registry and comparative case series. We present two cases of FAP diagnosed in Morocco. The two patients, one male and one female, had a mean age of 34 years. Initial colonoscopy revealed more than 100 polyps for both patients. The polyps varied in size and morphology, including flat, sessile, and pedunculated forms, and were distributed throughout the colon and rectum, and all showed adenomatous features on virtual chromoendoscopy. Histopathological examination of the polyps revealed a range of findings, from low-grade tubulovillous adenomas to moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed duodenal polyps, with histology confirming tubular adenomas exhibiting both low- and high-grade dysplasia. Both patients underwent surgery: one had a subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, and the other a total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. The clinical evolution was marked by the development of colon adenocarcinoma in one patient and rectal adenocarcinoma in the other. Regular surveillance of the duodenal polyps was recommended every 1-2 years.	Cureus	2025 Dec	['Belabbes FZ', 'Mounsif S', 'Arja R', 'Elkhannoussi B', 'Ben Elbarhdadi I']	41523393
Ultrasound Findings of Breast Cancer in Dialysis Patients Require Careful Evaluation: A Case Report.	Literature on the effects of renal failure on breast imaging in breast cancer patients on dialysis is scarce. A 73-year-old woman on dialysis noticed a mass in her left breast. In the left breast, which consisted entirely of fat tissue, mammography revealed two spiculated masses. Ultrasound also showed two irregular masses with internal low echoes, slightly attenuated posterior echoes, obscured margins, high depth-to-width ratios, no halos, and widespread peritumoral high echoes. In addition to axillary lymphadenopathy, MRI of the masses showed low signals on T1-weighted images and weakly high signals on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Core needle biopsy of the mass pathologically revealed atypical cells growing in trabecular and tubular patterns, with interstitial connective tissue proliferation and fat invasion, leading to a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Due to impaired renal function, the patient underwent primary surgery, including a partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathological examination showed scirrhous-type invasive ductal carcinomas infiltrating the surrounding fat tissue, nine metastatic lymph nodes, and abundant fat tissue with very scant mammary gland around the tumors. The patient had higher-than-usual postoperative drainage volumes, which varied from day to day, presumably due to the effects of dialysis. Despite a large 100 mL drainage volume on the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged on day six per her preference. Diagnostic physicians should note that breast cancer patients on dialysis can present with atypical breast imaging compared with patients without renal failure and should be treated with optimal surgical procedures based on thorough image evaluation.

Colon Perforation Caused by a Transanal Drainage Tube After Robot-Assisted Low Anterior Resection: A Case Report.	Transanal drainage tubes (TDTs) are commonly used after low anterior resection to reduce intraluminal pressure around the anastomosis. Although associated complications are usually minor, bowel perforation related to TDT placement is exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 71-year-old man who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer. A TDT was inserted intraoperatively, and its position was adjusted under laparoscopic guidance. Abdominal radiography performed on postoperative day (POD) 1 showed that the tube tip was located approximately 7 cm proximal to the anastomosis. On POD 4, the patient developed abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis. Computed tomography demonstrated free air and localized fluid collection near the tube tip. Anastomotic leakage or TDT-induced bowel perforation was suspected, and emergency reoperation was undertaken. Laparoscopic exploration confirmed that the TDT had penetrated the colon wall proximal to the anastomosis, resulting in a perforation. Primary suture repair of the perforation and creation of a diverting loop ileostomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient recovered without further complications. This case highlights an uncommon but serious complication associated with TDT placement and underscores the importance of meticulous intraoperative positioning, close postoperative monitoring, and prompt evaluation when unexpected abdominal symptoms arise.

Myristicin inhibits the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by deactivating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.	Lung cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in the world and the main cause of cancer related deaths. Among them, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancer. Myristicin (1-allyl-5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene), an active aromatic compound, has been proved to have anti-cancer effects. However, the effects of myristicin on NSCLC are not fully illustrated. Our research aimed to elucidate the roles and explain the potential mechanism of myristicin in NSCLC. A549 and H1975 cells were exposed to 0.5, 1, 5mM myristicin for 48 h, EdU, flow cytometry, Transwell and wound healing migration assay were applied for analyzing cell proliferation, apoptosis, cycle, migration and invasion, respectively. Caspase 3 activity and cleaved-Caspase3 expression were determined by relevant kits and western blotting, respectively. Besides, the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) related genes levels and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway related genes expressions, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Wnt3a and beta-catenin, were assessed by qRT-PCR, and western blot assays. The nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in NSCLC cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Our data revealed that myristicin suppressed NSCLC proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, myristicin led to cell apoptotic and G0/G1 arrest and enhancing Caspase3 activity in NSCLC. Moreover, myristicin inhibited NSCLC EMT and blocked Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner, as confirmed by enhanced E-cadherin expression, suppressed N-cadherin level, inhibited Wnt3a and beta-catenin levels, and reduced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Myristicin blocked the development of NSCLC via regulating cells proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT through deactivating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which provide a new therapeutic treatment for NSCLC in clinical.

Prediction Model for Low Bone Mineral Density in Cancer Survivors and Age-Matched Controls Using a Causal Bayesian Network: A Nationwide Population-Based Study in Korea.	BACKGROUND: With advances in cancer treatment, the number of cancer survivors has increased, bringing attention to long-term complications such as alterations in bone mineral density (BMD). Although survivors are at elevated risk for low BMD, prior studies have focused on specific cancer types and relied on traditional regression models, which are limited in capturing complex inter-variable relationships. This study aimed to examine the causal relationships among factors affecting BMD in cancer survivors and age-matched controls using causal Bayesian network (CBN) modeling. METHODS: Data from the 2010-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V were analyzed. We included 227 cancer survivors and 681 age- and sex-matched controls. Associations between BMD and variables such as age, sex, body composition, smoking, fracture history, and vitamin D were assessed using linear regression. A CBN model was then applied to evaluate probabilistic dependencies and potential causal relationships between variables and femoral neck BMD. RESULTS: Among all participants, age, sex, smoking, fracture history, body fat percentage, muscle mass, and cancer history were significantly associated with femoral neck BMD. In cancer survivors, age (beta = -0.032, P < .001) and sex (beta = -0.680, P < .001) showed negative associations with BMD, whereas higher muscle mass (beta = 0.073, P < .001) was a strong positive predictor. Smoking (beta = -0.779, P = .005) and previous fractures (beta = -0.507, P = .003) were also linked to lower BMD. The CBN model identified direct effects of age and muscle mass on BMD, with indirect effects from sex, smoking, and fracture history. Among women aged >60 years, greater muscle mass appeared particularly protective. CONCLUSION: Causal Bayesian network modeling identified muscle mass as a key modifiable factor influencing BMD among cancer survivors. These findings highlight the importance of muscle-preserving lifestyle interventions, including resistance exercise and adequate protein intake, in survivorship care. The CBN approach provides a framework for identifying individualized risk pathways and can support personalized bone-health management strategies in clinical practice.	Clinical Medicine Insights.

Characterization and Evaluation of the Anti-proliferative Activity and Hypersensitivity of L-Asparaginase from Trichosporon asahii Isolate ChL11 and Candida palmioleophila Isolate JK12.	BACKGROUND: L-Asparaginase is a crucial enzyme to treat Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), as it depletes L-asparagine, an essential amino acid for cancer cell survival. However, its clinical use is often restricted due to hypersensitivity reactions. This study examined the anti-proliferative effects and hypersensitivity of fungal L-asparaginases (L-ASNases) from Trichosporon asahii isolate ChL11 (TaIChL11 L-ASNase) and Candida palmioleophila isolate JK12 (CpIJK12 L-ASNase). METHODS: The enzymes were produced and purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography, and tested on leukemia cells and BALB/c female mice to assess immune responses. RESULTS: TaIChL11 L-ASNase had a molecular weight of 40 kDa, Michaelis constant (K(M)) of 1.66x10(-2) mM, and V(max) of 37.23 mM/min, while CpIJK12 L-ASNase had a molecular weight of 135 kDa, K(M) of 2.3x10(-2) mM, and V(max) of 14.03 mM/min. Both enzymes exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects against CCRF-CEM cancer cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 2.74 U/ml for TaIChL11 LASNase and 3.30 U/ml for CpIJK12 L-ASNase after 48 hr, improving further after 72 hr. They also showed low cytotoxicity toward normal Vero E6 cells. in vivo studies demonstrated that TaIChL11 ASNase-treated mice had significantly lower Immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels than those treated with commercial L-ASNase from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Owenism) (p<0.005), with no detectable IgE response. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that fungal L-ASNases, particularly TaIChL11 ASNase, with lower L-glutaminase activity and a favorable safety profile, could be promising alternatives to bacterial L-ASNases, potentially enhancing ALL treatment with fewer side effects.

Inhibition of ITGB6 stimulates potent anti-tumor responses in immunocompetent mouse models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	ITGB6, the gene encoding the beta6 subunit of integrin alphavbeta6, is a potent prognostic marker across multiple cancer types. As a major activator of latent TGFbeta and a potent modulator of the tumor immune environment, alphavbeta6, and consequently, ITGB6, has considerable therapeutic implications. ITGB6 is highly upregulated in squamous cell carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, where it disrupts tumor-immune cell signaling. We identify ITGB6 as a potent clinical prognostic marker of anti-tumor immune response and were able to recapitulate the immune-mediated anti-tumor effect of ITGB6 in pre-clinical mouse models. Genetic knockout of ITGB6 in heterotopically-injected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines shows markedly reduced tumor progression and immunogenic cytokine profiles in immunocompetent mice. Additionally, co-cultures of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma with human T-cells show increased T-cell killing upon cancer cell ITGB6 inhibition. Colony formation experiments give further evidence that the reduced tumor growth observed upon ITGB6 inhibition in vivo is through immunological clearance of cancer cells and not merely through intrinsic factors. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals the high prognostic value of ITGB6 on overall survival and that high ITGB6 expression in patients is associated with an inferior response to alpha-PD-1 and alpha-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade. The potent anti-tumor immune response observed both in vitro and in vivo upon ITGB6 inhibition, combined with analysis of RNA-seq data from immune checkpoint blockade-treated patients, encourages the development of ITGB6 blockade and immunotherapy combination regimens. Further pre-clinical studies should facilitate translation of our findings into therapeutic clinical trials for treating immunotherapy-resistant cancers.

USP5-mediated stabilization of ILF2 via deubiquitination drives the tumor growth of colorectal cancer.	Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (ILF2) has been confirmed to drive the progression and proliferation of multiple malignancies, but the expression and function of ILF2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain to be elucidated. In this study, the expression of ILF2 in CRC tissues was evaluated by the public tumor databases, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue array analyses. ILF2 was found to be elevated in CRC, and was predicted to serve as a negative index for patients. Subsequently, cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation, and tumor growth was evaluated by establishing xenografted mouse models. Our results showed that knockout of ILF2 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth of CRC. Moreover, we found ILF2 was ubiquitinated, and further co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated that ILF2 may be a novel substrate of the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin specific peptidase 5 (USP5). Further reciprocal Co-IP assays confirmed that ILF2 interacted with USP5. Enforced expression of USP5 reduced ubiquitinated ILF2 and increased ILF2 level, whereas catalytic inactive USP5 did not. While USP5 inhibitor WP1130 downregulated ILF2 and inhibited CRC cell growth, the effects were markedly abolished by ILF2 overexpression. These data demonstrate that the USP5/ILF2 axis mediates the tumorigenesis of CRC, which highlights the USP5/ILF2 axis as a promising therapeutic target for CRC treatment.

The role of EGFR mutations in sensitivity of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.	In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the most prevalent driver gene, whose expression and recurrent mutations are closely related to the prognosis of patients. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are ones of the most used among the first line treatment of NSCLC, but their efficacy is significantly reduced due to the inevitable development of acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. Consequently, searching for innovative drugs to overcome this challenge is urgent. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as antibodies against the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), have exhibited remarkable potential in NSCLC therapy. While the response rates of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients remain controversial. To gain deeper insights, we first analyzed the different therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade between EGFR wild-type and mutated NSCLC patients. Meanwhile, the factors and the mechanisms that affect therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade were summarized, including PD-1/PD-L1 expression levels, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the adoption of combination therapy strategies. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluated the combinatorial therapeutic effect with established synergistic potential within these factors. Moreover, we further explored the potential of PD-1/PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for EGFR mutations by conducting a systematic and multidimensional analysis, aiming to refine therapeutic decision-making and facilitate personalized treatment strategies for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Additionally, we also discussed the novel strategies that could alleviate the EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC base on PD-1/PD-L1 immune inhibitors, shedding light on challenges facing future research.

The clinicopathological features, treatment patterns, and prognosis of trichilemmal carcinoma: a retrospective case-series study.	Trichilemmal carcinoma (TC) is a rare malignant cutaneous appendage neoplasm originating from the epithelium of the outer root sheath of hair follicles. TC is generally non-invasive, causing only localized damage, and can be successfully managed with wide excision. Although recurrence and metastasis are rare, such cases often exhibit high malignancy, necessitating regular follow-up. Here, a retrospective study was conducted to review the clinical and histopathological features, diagnosis, and treatment of TC. Seven TC patients were enrolled in this study with 3 female and 4 male patients. The average age was 56.14+/-20.72 years old and the average year of lesion onset to clinic visit was 3.91+/-5.07 years. All patients received enlarged excision therapy. Six of Seven patients were followed for at least two years. Only one reported lesion relapse one year after surgery with 0.5 cm enlarged margin. In conclusion, surgery is a great method for TC treatment with at least 1 cm margin. Long-term post operative follow-up is necessary to screening recurrence.

The impact of radiogenomics on breast cancer.	Advances in radiomics and machine learning techniques have facilitated the extraction of quantitative radiomic features that can be correlated with genomic data. Breast MRI-based radiogenomics, which combines MRI radiomics and genomics, is an emerging field that non-invasively reflects tumor heterogeneity and assesses the biological behaviour of breast cancer. Studies have shown that radiogenomics has the potential to replace traditional genetic testing for breast cancer, reducing the need for invasive procedures such as biopsies. In the future, the clinical application of radiogenomics as a tool for molecular subtype identification, treatment response and prognosis prediction, and recurrence risk assessment is both necessary and feasible.

Factors associated with survival in patients with spinal metastases from lung cancer.	The spine is a common site for metastases in lung cancer. Precise identification of factors associated with survival and reliable prediction of prognosis are essential for clinical decision-making in patients with spinal metastasis from lung cancer. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 148 lung cancer patients with spinal metastases between January 2018 and December 2020 to identify prognostic factors and develop a nomogram for predicting survival outcomes. Another 30 patients with spinal metastases due to lung cancer, treated between January 2021 and February 2022, served as an external validation cohort to assess the nomogram's predictive performance. Multivariate analysis identified Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy as independent prognostic factors. The nomogram achieved a concordance index of 0.713. The AUCs for the nomogram in predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival were 0.834, 0.750, and 0.733 in the training set; 0.803, 0.738, and 0.713 in the internal validation set; and 0.749, 0.738, and 0.729 in the external validation set. Calibration curves showed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. Compared with the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, the nomogram demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and provided greater net clinical benefit in decision curve analysis, indicating good clinical utility. This model may aid individualized prognosis assessment and treatment planning in lung cancer patients with spinal metastases.

DERL3 exacerbates glioblastoma malignancy through endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent mechanisms.	Gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), represent the most prevalent primary intracranial malignancies, characterized by high invasiveness, aggressive proliferation, and poor clinical outcomes. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of tumor microenvironment interactions and cellular stress responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in modulating glioma progression. While ER stress can induce autophagy and apoptosis, glioma cells exhibit remarkable plasticity, adapting to stress conditions and exploiting them to promote survival and self-renewal, thereby contributing to therapeutic resistance. In this study, we established an individualized ER stress risk score using glioma transcriptomic data, demonstrating its association with adverse prognosis, aggressive molecular subtypes, and pro-tumorigenic biological functions. Through systematic screening, we identified DERL3 as a core effector gene mediating ER stress adaptation. Functional validation revealed that DERL3 drove glioma proliferation and invasion by binding to and stabilizing Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), consequently activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings elucidate the DERL3-HNRNPA2B1-NF-kappaB axis as a critical mechanistic link between ER stress adaptation and glioma malignancy. Targeting this axis may offer novel therapeutic strategies to overcome treatment resistance, providing significant translational potential for improving glioma management. This study advances our understanding of stress response mechanisms in tumorigenesis and underscores the clinical relevance of ER stress-related pathways in precision oncology.

A predictive model based on BRCA1/2, POLE, TP53, and MSH6 mutations for immunotherapy response in advanced endometrial cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical, molecular, and immunological predictors of response to immunotherapy among patients with advanced endometrial cancer and to develop a combined biomarker model for predicting treatment outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included 590 advanced endometrial cancer patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering between December 2024 and May 2025. Eligible women underwent total hysterectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and received immune checkpoint inhibitors alongside standard chemotherapy. Patients were stratified into good and poor response groups based on 1-year post-treatment prognosis and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Baseline blood biomarkers, gene mutation status (breast cancer gene [BRCA] 1, BRCA2, DNA polymerase epsilon, tumor protein p53 [TP53], mutS homolog 6), and immunophenoscore (IPS) were assessed. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. A random forest model was constructed for combined biomarker prediction. RESULTS: No significant differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics were found between response groups. Good responders had significantly lower baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), and IPS, and higher frequencies of gene mutations. Multivariate regression identified elevated CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, NLR, CA125, and IPS as independent predictors of poor response; BRCA2 and TP53 mutations were independently associated with favorable outcomes. The combined biomarker model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.812, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory and tumor biomarkers, IPS, and specific gene mutations are independently associated with immunotherapy response in advanced endometrial cancer. A combined biomarker model may enhance the prediction of treatment outcomes and guide individualized therapy.

Novel therapeutic agents and intensive chemotherapy improve survival outcomes in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare type of mature B-cell lymphoma. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes of patients with MCL in Taiwan. We collected baseline information, treatment modalities, and response evaluation of patients with MCL. A total of 204 patients who were diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma between November 2001 and July 2022 were included. When divided into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups according to the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, their median overall survival times were 83.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.7-NR), 72.7 (95% CI: 30.7-NR), and 19.3 (95% CI: 14.2-45.6) months, respectively. In this multicenter retrospective cohort, first line rituximab containing regimens, higher chemotherapy intensity, and ASCT were associated with longer PFS/OS, although the magnitude and statistical significance varied after adjustment and by transplant eligibility. Given potential confounding by indication, era effects, and missing data, these findings should be interpreted as observational associations rather than causal effects.

Selinexor combined with R-GDP as salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL) remains a therapeutic challenge with poor prognosis. Selinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export (XPO1), has shown activity in this setting. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of selinexor combined with R-GDP (rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin) as second-line therapy in 22 patients with R/R DLBCL treated at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between January 2023 and August 2023. Patients were scheduled to receive 3 cycles of selinexor plus R-GDP, and subsequently followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, or alternative regimens, as appropriate. At a median follow-up of 25.5 months, the selinexor plus R-GDP regimen yielded an overall response rate of 52.4% in patients with R/R DLBCL. The median overall survival (OS) was 26.9 months (95% CI, 12.1-not reached), with 1- and 2-year OS rates of 67.6% and 52.3%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months (95% CI, 2.27-not reached). Survival outcomes were significantly influenced by subsequent therapy: patients bridged to ASCT or CAR-T therapy had significantly longer OS (P=0.0217) and PFS (P=0.0029) than those receiving other treatments. The median OS was not reached in the ASCT group, 26.9 months (95% CI, 15.9-not reached) in the CAR-T group, and 11.2 months (95% CI, 10.2-not reached) in patients receiving other therapies. The median PFS was not reached for ASCT or CAR-T group, compared with 2.2 months (95% CI, 2.1-not reached) in patients receiving other therapies. Additionally, patients with relapsed disease exhibited a significantly longer median PFS than those with primary refractory disease (not reached vs 2.82 months, [95% CI, 2.17-not reached]; P=0.0072). No significant difference in OS was observed between these two groups (P=0.2323). Common adverse events included thrombocytopenia (100%), fatigue (59%), neutropenia (45%), anemia (45%), and pneumonia (23%), while were manageable through supportive care or temporary dose interruption. In this real-world analysis, selinexor combined with R-GDP demonstrated modest efficacy in R/R DLBCL, while highlighting the importance of optimizing subsequent sequencing with ASCT or CAR-T therapy.

Targeted therapy for KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer: advances, challenges, and future directions.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with approximately 40% of the patients carrying KRAS mutations. Among these, the KRAS G12C mutation accounts for approximately 4% of the cases. This mutation introduces a unique cysteine residue at codon 12, enabling covalent binding and rendering KRAS G12C a tractable therapeutic target. Recently, selective small-molecule inhibitors of KRAS G12C, including sotorasib and adagrasib, have shown encouraging activity in early clinical trials, indicating potential clinical benefits for this subset of patients. However, their translation into routine clinical practice has been challenged by intrinsic and acquired resistance, treatment-related toxicities, and the absence of reliable predictive biomarkers. The aim of this study is to construct a clear knowledge framework that could inform the design of future clinical trials and optimize clinical practice. Future studies should focus on developing more potent next-generation inhibitors, exploring and optimizing rational combination strategies with other targeted agents or immunotherapies, investigating innovative therapeutic methods, and systematically identifying and validating predictive biomarkers. Collectively, with these efforts, we aim to enhance the efficacy, overcome resistance, and advance precision therapy for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant CRC.

Comparison of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative staging of endometrioma (EC) is essential for optimal treatment planning. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (IV-CEUS) as a potential modality for EC staging. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 71 patients with histologically confirmed EC who were admitted to Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics between January 2021 and August 2024. All patients had undergone both IV-CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 14 days before surgery. IV-CEUS was performed using high-end Doppler ultrasound systems with SonoVue((R)) contrast, while MRI was conducted on a 1.5 T scanner employing T2 weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences. Deep myometrial invasion (DMI; >/= 50%) and cervical stromal invasion (CSI) were assessed, with final histopathological findings serving as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, Kappa coefficients, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: For DMI diagnosis, IV-CEUS demonstrated a sensitivity of 74.2%, specificity of 92.5%, PPV of 88.5%, NPV of 82.2%, and accuracy of 84.5% (kappa = 0.68). MRI showed a sensitivity of 90.3%, specificity of 85.0%, and accuracy of 87.3% (kappa = 0.75). For CSI diagnosis, IV-CEUS had a sensitivity of 69.2%, specificity of 93.1%, an accuracy of 88.7% (kappa = 0.62), while MRI had a sensitivity of 76.9%, specificity of 87.9%, and accuracy of 85.9% (kappa = 0.60). The areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.704 (95% CI: 0.584-0.824) for IV-CEUS and 0.718 (95% CI: 0.602-0.834) for MRI in diagnosing DMI; and those were 0.852 (95% CI: 0.743-0.961) for IV-CEUS and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.721-0.955) for MRI in diagnosing CSI. CONCLUSION: IV-CEUS demonstrates comparable diagnostic performance to MRI in assessing DMI and CSI in EC patients. It may serve as a viable alternative when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable.
