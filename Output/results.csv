Changes in US Skilled Nursing Facility Capacity Following the COVID-19 Pandemic.	IMPORTANCE: Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are the primary provider of institutional postacute care. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been reports of SNFs reducing their capacity, affecting access to care and disrupting hospital discharges, yet little empirical evidence exists. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in SNF capacity after 2020 and assess whether changes were associated with staffing shortages and hospital discharge outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, data from the 2018-2024 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Payroll-Based Journal on patient censuses in US skilled nursing facilities were assessed. Descriptive analyses characterized trends in SNF capacity from 2018 to 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were SNF licensed bed count and estimated operating capacity. Secondary outcomes included SNF staffing shortages, mean hospital length of stay, percentage of hospital admissions lasting 28 days or more, and the median distance traveled to admitting SNFs. County-level regression analyses examined the association between changes in SNF capacity and the frequency of SNF staffing shortages. Hospital-level regressions examined the association between changes in nearby SNF capacity and discharge outcomes. RESULTS: Among US skilled nursing facilities, the number of licensed SNF beds declined by 2.5% between 2019 and 2024, while operating capacity declined by 5.0% over the same time period. There was substantial geographic variation-1 in 4 counties experienced operating capacity declines of 15.1% or more, with the largest declines being more common among rural counties. SNF capacity declines were larger in counties with more frequent reports of SNF staffing shortages-a 1-percentage point decline in county SNF capacity was associated with a 0.20-percentage point (95% CI, 0.11-0.29) increase in the frequency of reported shortages. Additionally, hospitals that experienced larger declines in nearby SNF capacity experienced greater increases in mean length of stay, percentage of stays lasting 28 or more days, and median distance traveled to admitting SNFs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this study suggest that SNF operating capacity declined following the pandemic and these declines were larger than the observed declines in licensed SNF bed counts, potentially because of staffing shortages. Greater loss of SNF capacity was associated with longer hospital stays and increased travel distances to SNFs, suggesting that declines in operating capacity may be impairing access to care.

The US Food and Drug Administration's Regulation of Mifepristone.	IMPORTANCE: Mifepristone, used with misoprostol, is the most common abortion regimen in the US. It is also a focal point of reproductive health policy and politics, with controversy over its legal status and regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: To characterize the FDA's decision-making with respect to the regulation of mifepristone, with a particular interest in the agency's rationale for establishing, maintaining, or modifying key components of its regulatory approach over time. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Qualitative analysis of 5239 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, including sponsors' Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) assessment reports, FDA review of these reports, internal memos, and regulatory correspondence (2011-2023), supplemented by a review of publicly available information. Review focused on FDA justifications for implementing, maintaining, or modifying postapproval safety measures and the supporting evidence cited. FINDINGS: Five key moments in the FDA's regulation of mifepristone that have led to the current state of oversight were identified: (1) conversion to the REMS framework in June 2011; (2) reevaluation of REMS necessity in October 2013; (3) a sponsor-requested label change in May 2015; (4) the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021; and (5) a comprehensive reassessment of the REMS in November 2021. Key themes across this period were consistent findings on safety, lack of ideological bias in staff scientists' recommendations, and the limited impact of political interference-to date-on the agency's oversight. Even as litigation, the COVID-19 public health emergency, and evolving practice standards changed the context of mifepristone regulation, the agency generally followed the policy approach favored by scientists at the agency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: FDA oversight of mifepristone, developed during key moments from 2011 to 2023, has been shaped by scientific evidence and a cautious regulatory approach led by scientists at the agency.

The effect of age-specific stay-at-home recommendation on healthcare utilization: Evidence from Finland's COVID-19 policy.	Postponements of non-acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic commonly raised concerns about harmful health consequences and increased healthcare costs, particularly among older individuals. Using nationwide register data from Finland, we employ a regression discontinuity design to examine the effect of an age-specific stay-at-home recommendation on healthcare utilization during the first wave of the pandemic. We find that the recommendation reduced non-acute visits, such as dental care, physiotherapy, and specialized care visits, but had no effect on acute care use, including emergency department visits or inpatient stays. The reductions in dental care use were partly compensated for after the lockdown was lifted, but not in other non-acute services. Additionally, we find indicative evidence of a slight increase in mortality during the three-months post-period after the lockdown. Our findings suggest that a Scandinavian-type social distancing recommendation targeting the elderly may reduce non-acute healthcare use in the short term, thereby temporarily alleviating pressure on healthcare resources during a pandemic. However, the absence of rebound in some non-acute services highlight potential unmet needs, which may imply longer-term risks of functional decline, preventable hospitalizations, and associated healthcare costs. These findings point to the importance of policies that ensure continued access to essential non-acute care for older populations.

Understanding the Complexities of Peripartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders: A Qualitative Assessment of Current Issues in Management and Treatment.	OBJECTIVES: Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) are an important public health issue that can have detrimental consequences to both the woman and the child. Despite our extensive understanding about the consequences and the availability of treatments, only 3% individuals with PMADs are treated to remission. Our aim was to understand the community's needs, barriers to accessing care for PMADs, and obtain feedback on current services. METHODS: In this study, we carried out qualitative interviews with 32 relevant individuals from varied backgrounds to understand the complexities related to PMADs and barriers to help-seeking. These narratives were transcribed, and an inductive thematic analysis approach was used to identify codes which were used in an iterative manner until data saturation was reached. RESULTS: Three broad themes were identified related to the key questions including prevalence, barriers to care and finally, service needs and home visiting programs. All participants acknowledged the high prevalence of PMADs, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. They identified multiple barriers related to individual attitudes, knowledge, and stigma; health systems knowledge, attitude and access; and social determinants including poverty, race, geography, childcare and insurance. They also identified societal and cultural attitudes and the role of social support systems in help-seeking. All participants acknowledged the importance of home-visiting programs in addressing the needs of peripartum individuals. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide an in-depth insight into the complex underpinnings of PMADs, particularly barriers to accessing care. This information, along with the positive feedback on home-visiting programs, can contribute to the development of innovative programs.

Gender-specific Differences in Radiation Oncology Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Subanalysis.	The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted cancer education across specialties. Radiation oncology, with its highly technical nature and multidisciplinary approach, faced unique challenges in maintaining training quality while adapting to pandemic restrictions. This subanalysis of a nationwide survey on oncological training quality during the pandemic examines gender-specific differences within radiation oncology specialist training. We analyzed survey responses from 85 radiation oncologists (58 females, 27 males) conducted between February and November 2022, focusing on workload changes, educational access, digital learning adaptation, and training quality assessment. Male radiation oncologists experienced more frequent work disruptions, including temporary departmental relocation (48.1% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.027) and significant work assignment changes (categories 4 + 5: 55.5% vs. 17.2%, p = 0.002). Males reported better access to digital learning alternatives, including e-learning platforms (37.0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.001) and live online teaching (51.9% vs. 20.7%, p = 0.004), while females more frequently lacked alternatives for clinical training (55.2% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.012). Gender differences emerged in perceived negative training factors, with males more concerned about team meeting disruptions (categories 4 + 5: 51.8% vs. 41.4%, p = 0.022) and females about personal work absences (categories 4 + 5: 31.0% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.015). Despite these operational differences, overall training and work quality assessments remained comparable between genders. The pandemic affected male and female radiation oncologists through different pathways, with males experiencing more work deployment changes and better digital access, while females faced greater gaps in training alternatives. These findings highlight the importance of gender-sensitive crisis response planning to ensure equitable training opportunities during future health emergencies.

Rationale and Design of the Roflumilast or Azithromycin to Prevent COPD Exacerbations Clinical Trial.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death, particularly among patients with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations. Results of placebo-controlled clinical trials indicate that treatment escalation with either long-term oral roflumilast or azithromycin can reduce COPD exacerbations. However, head-to-head comparative data from clinical trials are lacking, so the relative harms and benefits of these treatments are unclear. The RELIANCE (RofLumilast or Azithromycin to preveNt COPD Exacerbations) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial embedded in clinical practice to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment escalation with long-term azithromycin versus roflumilast in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis. We solicited preferences from patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders during the design and implementation phases of the study, including feedback that informed modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility criteria did not require assessments outside of clinical practice, with exclusions principally for safety. The composite endpoint of first all-cause hospitalization or death served as the primary outcome. Enrollment was initially through university-affiliated Clinical Centers but was subsequently expanded to recruit patients in community-based practices who might not otherwise participate in research. We employed human-centered design principles to improve the usability of study activities from the perspective of participants, study staff, and treating clinicians. The final study design offered the option for patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis at high-risk of hospitalization or death to be remotely consented, prescribed a medication according to the randomized treatment allocation, and complete virtual follow-up study visits in a decentralized clinical trial.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Mortality Among Decedents Aged >/=15 Years - United States, 2018-2023.	OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition that can lead to death. To examine SLE as an underlying and contributing cause of mortality, CDC analyzed 2018-2023 mortality data for persons aged >/=15 years overall and by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and region. METHODS: Death certificate data for persons aged >/=15 years with any mention of SLE (ICD-10 code M32) were analyzed using CDC WONDER. We calculated age-adjusted death rates and assessed patterns by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and region. Underlying and contributing causes of death were evaluated using ranked cause-of-death lists and ICD sub-chapters. RESULTS: During 2018-2023, 14,936 deaths had any mention of SLE listed on the death certificate. Of these deaths, 6,414 (42.9%) listed SLE as the underlying cause. The age-adjusted SLE mortality rate per million population was greater among females (5.97) than males (1.16), non-Hispanic African American persons (10.70) versus persons of other non-Hispanic racial groups (range: 2.46 to 5.62), Hispanic versus non-Hispanic persons (3.98 versus 3.59), and in the South (4.37) versus other regions. Where SLE was listed as a contributing cause of death, the leading underlying causes were heart disease (0.93), cancer (0.56), and COVID-19 (0.51). The overall age-adjusted SLE mortality rates were significantly higher in 2020 and 2021 versus all other study years indicating the likely impact of COVID-19 pandemic on SLE mortality. CONCLUSION: Overall management of SLE and co-morbidities and infections in SLE patients, as well as interventions targeting groups (e.g., African American persons) disproportionately impacted by SLE, may reduce overall SLE mortality.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university performance: a retrospective follow-up study of the University of Split, Croatia.	BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the academic performance, financial health, scientific output, and student and staff mobility of higher education institutions globally. Here, we report on a retrospective analysis of the core activities at the University of Split, Croatia, from 2017 to 2023, with a focus on the pandemic's impact thereon. METHODS: Using interrupted time series analysis, we examined trends in student success, research output, financial indicators, and mobility patterns before, during, and after the pandemic, with a total of 34 indicators. RESULTS: We found no significant disruptions in academic performance, financial stability, or overall institutional operations at the university level, while the observed differences at the faculty level were unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, in the observed period, the University of Split did not experience measurable pandemic-related disruptions in key academic, financial, and operational indicators. They emphasise the importance of institutional preparedness, digital adaptability, and financial diversification to ensure the stability and resilience of higher education institutions in future crises.

Nationwide insights on early childhood neurodevelopment during a global health crisis: evidence from COVID-19 in South Korea.	BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted early childhood environments globally, raising concerns about its potential impacts on neurodevelopment. Although early childhood is a critical developmental period, large-scale evidence from South Korea - where strict social distancing and unique caregiving structures were in place - remains limited. We aim to evaluate age- and domain-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes among children aged 0-5 years before and during the pandemic, focusing on differences by age and sex. METHODS: We analysed children aged 0-5 years using data from a national health screening programme and a pre-post comparison design with repeated cross-sectional data. We compared the pre-pandemic (July 2018-March 2020) and pandemic (April 2020-December 2021) periods. We categorised children into infants (9-12 months), toddlers (18-36 months), and preschoolers (42-71 months). We measured developmental outcomes using the Korean Developmental Screening Test across six domains: gross motor, fine motor, cognition, language, social skills, and self-help. We conducted multivariable logistic regression and difference-in-differences analyses. RESULTS: We analysed 6 253 076 assessments from 2 797 459 children. Peer-level developmental status declined significantly during the pandemic across all age groups, with the most pronounced decrease among toddlers (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-0.92), followed by infants and preschoolers. The language domain experienced the greatest decline (aOR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.86-0.88), whereas the gross motor domain showed significant improvement (aOR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.11-1.15). Boys were more adversely affected than girls, particularly in gross motor and social skill domains. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant developmental declines among young children, particularly in language and social domains and among toddlers. Boys were more adversely affected than girls, especially in language and socioemotional skills, highlighting sex-related vulnerabilities. Prioritising early screening and interventions targeting these key domains, alongside sex-sensitive strategies and caregiver support, will be essential to mitigate developmental disruptions during future pandemics.

Heterogeneity in Asian Americans' mortality trends, 2000-2022.	OBJECTIVES: Although Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, their recent mortality trends have not been sufficiently studied. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of years of life lost (YLL) from age 25 to 84 among six largest Asian ethnic groups, comparing them to non-Hispanic Whites. METHODS: We analyzed data from the CDC Multiple Cause of Death database and the American Community Survey (2000-2022) using a cause of death decomposition method. RESULTS: Among college-educated individuals, all Asian ethnic groups experienced either a smaller decrease or an increase in YLL compared to Whites in 2000-2022. These disparities were not primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, though Filipinos and Indians were disproportionately affected compared to Whites. Instead, the divergence in YLL trends predates 2020. Indians showed the most unfavorable trend, with YLL worsening even before the pandemic, followed by Koreans. At least 75% of the smaller YLL reductions among Asians were due to slower improvements in mortality from circulatory diseases, cancer, and diabetes. These findings indicate a less favorable mortality trend for Asian Americans compared to White Americans, particularly the college-educated, in the early 21st century. They also suggest that, over time, Asians may be deriving diminishing health returns from higher education compared to Whites. DISCUSSION: We discuss differential trends between Whites and Asians, as well as variation within Asian ethnic and educational groups, in the context of socioeconomic conditions, labor market dynamics, racialization in the United States, and stages of nutrition transition in countries of origin.

Navigating Complexities In Randomized Trials: Insights From The EMERGE Trial Amidst Pandemic And Cybersecurity Threat.	INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus changed the global landscape of clinical trials; changes in staffing, clinical priorities and recruitment challenges led to the delay or termination of many clinical trials. The Early Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (EMERGE) trial was completed despite COVID-19 and institutional computer network attacks (CNAs). METHODS: Here we outline the challenges encountered and the solutions employed to continue the active recruitment of a potentially high risk patient cohort during the Covid-19 pandemic and detail the techniques adapted to enable recruitment, adverse event reporting and lab reporting during two critical computer network attacks. We present our solutions from both the site and sponsor perspective. RESULTS: COVID-19 and the computer network attacks presented many challenges for the clinical trial site and Sponsor including staff shortages, remote working, deferred recruitment, changes in the diagnostic pathway for gestational diabetes mellitus and pivoting to remote working and telemedicine. The first CNA impeded clinical and laboratory systems, impacting recruitment and follow up. The second CNA delayed access to the Clinical Data Management System. Solutions employed included telemedicine, videoconferencing, shortened in-person reviews, contact tracing, COVID-19 risk mitigations, paper-based back-up systems and vigorous data integrity checks. CONCLUSION: Overcoming the multiple challenges posed by COVID-19 and computer network attacks required rapid re-organisation, teamwork and flexibility from staff and Sponsor. The use of both digital solutions and paper-based records highlighted the importance of rapid innovation and comprehensive protocol planning.

Laboratory test results and computed tomography findings in health care professionals with COVID-19.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the intensity, characteristics, and distribution of computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary involvement, as well as to evaluate laboratory test results, in health care professionals who were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study based on the analysis of laboratory test results and chest CT images of health care workers with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data for the period from March 2020 to December 2022 were collected from two hospitals in Brazil. RESULTS: We identified 1,091 health care professionals in whom a RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, only 38 of those individuals underwent chest CT. Of the 38 individuals evaluated, 89.5% were treated at one of the hospitals and 57.9% were male. The mean age was 55.6 years. The most common finding (in 100% of the cases) was ground-glass opacity, followed by septal thickening (in 31.6%) and consolidation (in 23.7%). Pulmonary involvement was multifocal in 76.3% and predominantly subpleural in 71.0%. The extent of the involvement was classified as mild in 24% of the cases, moderate in 47%, and severe in 29%. The most commonly affected lung region (in 60.7% of cases) was the lower lobes, particularly the right posterior basal segmental bronchus (segment B10). CONCLUSION: For evaluating lung involvement, CT was essential, aiding in postinfection monitoring and in the early management of complications. Among the health care professionals evaluated, moderate involvement predominated.

Disinfection of Simulated Residual SARS-CoV-2 in Air by Chlorine Dioxide Gas in an Ambulance Setting.	INTRODUCTION: Disinfecting contaminated ambulances presents a challenge to emergency medical services. The process relies on a manual cleaning step or the use of foggers and gas generators. Equipment requires training, power supply, and access to reagent refills. Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) gas is an affordable, easy-to-use alternative. METHODS: We field-tested ClO(2) dry inside an ambulance against a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. MS2 bacteriophage was aerosolized inside of an enclosed. Airborne MS2 concentrations were measured before and after ClO(2) applications to compare reductions in viable virus. ClO(2) gas was generated using ICA-TriNova UltraShok 2-part media in different concentrations and time courses. Petri dishes were used to determine the surface deposition of residual MS2 phage. ClO(2) gas was monitored using a PortaSens III gas detector with high and low range sensors. RESULTS: MS2 bacteriophage measured at 15-min averaged 99.99% in both 100 g and 130 g applications, compared to 83.48% in controls. At 60-min, air MS2 percent reductions averaged 99.99% in 100 g applications compared to 98.05% in controls. Mean surface MS2 counts within protocols using ClO(2) gas ranged from 245 to 5110 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/petri-dish compared to 13,900-44,900 PFU/petri-dish in controls. ClO(2) gas concentrations fell below OSHA 15-min short-term exposure limit of 0.3 PPM within 5 min of passive ventilation in all tests. There were no observed detrimental impacts on materials and surfaces. CONCLUSION: ClO(2) gas produced using ICA-TriNova UltraShok 2-part media is an effective air disinfection technique for contaminated ambulance settings. Integration with manual cleaning permits safe, rapid decontamination of ambulance vehicles.

Long-Term Self-Reported Symptoms Among Adults After COVID-19 Infection in the West Bank: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.	INTRODUCTION: With growing recognition of the prolonged effects of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand its extended clinical and public health implications across diverse settings. Long-term consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection remain insufficiently studied in Middle Eastern populations. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms among Palestinian adults and to evaluate their associations with hospitalization and recovery duration. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a randomized sample of 407 adult COVID-19 patients confirmed by the Palestinian Ministry of Health between November 25 and December 15, 2020. We used a standardized Arabic questionnaire to cover demographics, medical history, symptoms, complications, and physical activity. Data were gathered by phone interviews in October 2021. All data came from self-reports. With significance defined at p < 0.05, associations between the symptom duration, hospitalization, and recovery time were examined using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The study population had a mean age of 40 years; 54% were female, and 70.3% had no previous medical history. Common complaints were fatigue (64.9%), anosmia (61.9%), joint pain (52.6%), and headache (51.8%). Hospitalization was necessary in 7.6% of patients, while 5.9% required oxygen or intubation. Most patients (92.6%) recovered in 4 months. The persistence of chest pain (chi (2), 16.225), shortness of breath (chi (2), 13.257), and lethargy (chi (2), 8.194) was significantly associated with hospitalization (p < 0.001). The persistence of the previously mentioned symptoms was significantly associated with the duration of recovery. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insights into the long-term symptoms experienced by individuals recovering from COVID-19 in the West Bank. The findings carry implications for clinicians, public health authorities, and affected individuals, highlighting the importance of integrated care strategies and sustained support throughout the postacute phase of the disease.

The Role of Health-Related Factors in the Prevalence and Severity of COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study Based on Sabzevar Persian Cohort Data.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Identifying the health-related risk factors for COVID-19 may improve future prevention strategies. This study aimed to investigate the association between pre-pandemic health-related factors and the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 using data from the Sabzevar center of the PERSIAN cohort study. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 4241 individuals aged 35-70 from the Sabzevar PERSIAN cohort. Health-related baseline data (demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, and chronic disease history) collected between 2017 and 2018 were linked with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and clinical outcomes (outpatient, hospitalization, or ICU admission/death) recorded in the health information system (HIS) between 2019 and early 2021. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed using t-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 positivity was confirmed in 423 individuals (10%). Diabetes and lower education levels were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p < 0.05). Severity of disease was significantly higher among individuals aged >/= 60, those with higher BMI, lower education, and comorbidities such as thyroid and ischemic heart disease. Baseline biochemical markers such as WBC, FBS, TG, and cholesterol levels were also associated with increased disease severity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pre-existing health-related factors-especially chronic diseases and demographic characteristics like age and education-are associated with both the likelihood of infection and the severity of COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of targeted preventive strategies for at-risk populations, particularly the elderly and those with underlying conditions.

Prevalence of burnout among Brazilian Army soldiers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional analysis.	INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of frontline workers, including military personnel. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome among Brazilian Army personnel during the pandemic and identify associated predictive variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 602 volunteer military personnel in the city of Santa Maria, Brazil. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess burnout syndrome, defined by high levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, or low personal accomplishment. Logistic regression was performed to identify associated factors. RESULTS: The prevalence ofburnout syndrome was 48.7%. High levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment were found in 53.8%, 58.4%, and 27.0% of participants, respectively. Emotional exhaustion was more common in those with over 10 years of service (p = 0.001), higher rank (p < 0.001), and age > 40 years (p = 0.008). Low personal accomplishment was associated with lower rank (p = 0.007) and administrative duties (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Burnout syndrome was highly prevalent among military personnel in Brazil during the pandemic, with findings similar to those observed in other professional groups.

Evaluation of short and long-term laboratory and instrumental findings in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Tuscany.	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization defined long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation. AIM: To evaluate the potential laboratory and instrumental findings (short-term and long-term) resulting from COVID-19. METHODS: This longitudinal observational COVID-19 cohort study (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021) was carried out on patients >/= 18 years old who were admitted to the University Hospitals of Pisa, Siena and Careggi and the Azienda USL Toscana Nord Ovest, Sud Est and USL Centro Toscana and were subjected to follow-up. Follow-up was conducted between 0 day and 89 days, 90 days and 179 days, 180 days and 269 days, 270 days and 359 days, and more than 360 days after hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 2887 patients (58.5% males, average age 66.2 years) hospitalized in the study period (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021) carrying out at least one follow-up examination within 12 months of discharge, a total of 1739 patients (705 males, average age 66 years) underwent laboratory tests, of whom 714 patients (470 males, average age 63 years) underwent spirometry. Some laboratory test results remained above the threshold even at follow-up beyond 360 days (C-reactive protein: 36%, fibrin degradation fragment: 48.8%, gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16.8%), while others showed a return to normal range more quickly in almost all patients. Alterations in liver enzymes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes and neutrophils were associated with the risk of requiring oxygen therapy or forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity alterations at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Alterations in liver enzymes, hematocrit or hemoglobin, lymphocytes and neutrophils were associated with risk outcomes (need for oxygen therapy or spirometry alterations). These imbalanced conditions may contribute to pulmonary dysfunction.

Epigenetic Modulation of IL-7 and IL-10: Toward Personalized Immune Therapies in Viral Epidemics.	BACKGROUND: Host immune responses, including cytokine production, shape the severity of viral epidemics. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation regulate cytokine gene expression and may contribute to immune dysregulation in severe disease. METHODS: This study analyzed interleukin-7 (IL-7), IL-8, and IL-10 promoter methylation in 145 COVID-19 patients (91 wards, 54 intensive care units (ICUs)), excluding 12 patients receiving epigenetically active drugs. Peripheral blood DNA underwent bisulfite conversion, followed by PCR and gel electrophoresis. Gene-specific methylation levels were quantified using beta values. RESULTS: IL-7 was significantly hypermethylated overall (beta = 0.835, p < 0.001), especially in ICU patients (beta = 0.863, p = 0.001), independent of age, mortality, and malignancy. An interaction between age and ICU status indicated group-specific effects. IL-10 showed significant hypomethylation (beta = 0.243, p < 0.001), while IL-8 methylation did not differ significantly (p = 0.373). ICU patients had higher mortality (26% vs 5.5%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: IL-7 hypermethylation may impair T-cell-mediated immunity in severe cases, while IL-10 hypomethylation may reflect enhanced immunosuppression. These findings suggest a role for epigenetic cytokine regulation in disease progression and may guide future immunomodulatory strategies.

Quantification of Droplet Aerosol Generation During Phacoemulsification and Pars Plana Vitrectomy.	Introduction Intraocular procedures such as phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may generate fine droplet aerosols that are relevant to infection control, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Data on aerosol production during cataract and vitrectomy surgery, especially in human tissue and with different wound constructions, remain limited. This study used a high-sensitivity optical particle spectrometer to quantify droplet aerosols (0.12-8.00 mum in diameter) generated during phacoemulsification in cadaveric human eyes with 2.2 mm and 2.75 mm corneal incisions, to assess whether hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) reduces aerosol production, and to measure aerosol generation during individual steps of PPV. Methods Tests were performed on one model eye and two human cadaveric eyes. A printed optical particle spectrometer (POPS) was used to measure droplet aerosol generation during phacoemulsification through 2.2 mm and 2.75 mm main corneal incisions, with and without HPMC coating, and during predefined stages of 23-gauge PPV. Particle number concentration (PNC, particles cm(-)(3)) was recorded each second and summarised as mean PNC for each condition. Results In this small series, mean PNC during phacoemulsification without HPMC appeared to be higher with 2.75 mm incisions than with 2.2 mm incisions, and counts of particles >1 mum in diameter were also greater. Application of HPMC was associated with reduced aerosol counts. The maximum measured mean PNC without HPMC for 2.2 mm corneal incisions was 88 cm(-)(3), which fell to 66 cm(-)(3) with HPMC (p<0.05). For 2.75 mm incisions, the maximum measured mean PNC without HPMC was 493 cm(-)(3), falling to 61 cm(-)(3) with HPMC (p<0.05). No increase in droplet aerosol was detected during vitrectomy apart from during air infusion through a leaking trocar valve. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to use whole cadaveric human eyes in combination with a high-sensitivity optical particle spectrometer to quantify airborne particle number and size during phacoemulsification and PPV. In this model, droplet aerosol production during cataract surgery appeared lower with 2.2 mm incisions and with HPMC coating of the cornea. Droplet aerosols may be generated during vitrectomy when air infusion is delivered through a leaking trocar valve, highlighting the importance of port integrity.

Centralized clinical research operations reporting for a multi-network, multi-study research program: The NHLBI COVID-19 CONNECTS experience.	The Collaborating Network of Networks for Evaluating COVID-19 and Therapeutic Strategies (CONNECTS) was a novel network of networks created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This program brought together a large matrix of clinical research networks to swiftly design and/or implement concurrent clinical studies. Successful coordination of this large-scale collaboration required innovative solutions for timely and transparent centralized operations reporting. As the Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) for CONNECTS, RTI International developed and maintained a web-based infrastructure that served as the central communication and reporting hub. This single-platform approach provided a robust collection of key topics to support daily operational oversight (e.g., enrollment and retention, site coverage, study milestones, financial tracking). Underlying data acquisition, harmonization, and portal reporting methods aimed to address nuances of the network of networks (e.g., disparate data sources, diverse user needs) while providing the necessary speed and agility to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting system was well received, readily adapted to changes, and successfully supported three years of early COVID-19 research. Although the CONNECTS central reporting methods arose from necessity during an urgent and dynamic public health emergency, they are a model for efficient and effective centralized operational reporting for any large-scale public health research effort.

Long COVID incidence across SARS-CoV-2 lineages and identification of conserved spike targets for multivalent vaccines.	BACKGROUND: Long COVID remains poorly characterized at the genomic level. The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between viral sequences and the incidence of Long COVID at a tertiary care center in Louisiana between April 2020 and December 2022. A secondary aim was analysis of the Spike protein to identify conserved regions for multivalent vaccine targets. METHOD: To estimate Long COVID incidence across variants, we linked 4789 SARS-CoV-2 sequences to 3090 de-identified patient electronic health record information. The base population was defined as any patient with an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) based definitions of Long COVID presentation developed by the N3C consortium. RESULTS: 1,554 patients (1,536 Long COVID-negative) met Long COVID definitions, with 56.3% being female, 36.1% self-reported as African American, 5.5% self-reported as Hispanic/Latino, and 54.5% had received at least one vaccine dose 14 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 collection. Long COVID-positive patients were older (mean age 43.1 years) than negative patients (35.9 years; p = 0.0054) and were more likely to be female (p = 0.0001). Among unvaccinated patients, those with Long COVID were significantly younger than their vaccinated counterparts (p < 0.00001). Long COVID incidence varied by PANGO lineage, ranging between 14% in AY.13 to 67.8% in B.1.1.7. Analysis of spike protein diversity revealed eight conserved amino acid regions (Shannon entropy < 0.43), representing potential targets for vaccine design. CONCLUSION: Long COVID rates across thousands of annotated SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed lineage-specific risk and conserved epitopes for future interventions.

Evidence-based strategies for delivering grant writing skills to clinical and translational science faculty in the Mountain West.	Acquiring the skills to obtain extramural funding is a major challenge for early- and mid-career investigators. The Professional Development Core (PDC) of the NIH-funded Mountain West Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (MW CTR-IN) aims to support early-stage and mid-career investigators pursuing independent careers in clinical and translational science research. Since 2018, the PDC's Grant Writing Workshops (GWWs) have provided CTR investigators with didactic content and interactive feedback on their NIH grant applications, helping them reach this key career milestone. Four one-day GWWs were offered in person, and two half-day GWWs were offered virtually across two days during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation data for each cohort revealed that participants' knowledge and confidence in the relevant sections of NIH R-series grants consistently improved following GWW attendance and resulted in notable enhancements in participants' feelings of positivity toward grant writing, regardless of delivery mode (virtual vs. in-person). Follow-up data showed that 12 GWW participants acquired external funding with a 21% success rate and $12,584,938 in total funding. This manuscript provides a roadmap for planning and implementing a successful virtual or in-person GWW that positively impacts the careers of early-stage and mid-career investigators.

Old Bug, New Challenge: Invasive Group A Streptococcus and a Rare Pediatric Holospinal Epidural Abscess.	Invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections have risen in the post-COVID-19 era, with significant morbidity and mortality in children. Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare, life-threatening condition, and pediatric cases are scarcely reported. SEA caused by iGAS is even more unusual, with only sporadic case reports in the literature. Herein, a challenging case of pediatric SEA due to iGAS is described, raising awareness of this clinical entity. An otherwise healthy 18-month-old girl presented with a three-day history of gait disturbance, high temperature, and seizures. Lumbar puncture revealed pus, and cultures grew group A Streptococcus. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a holospinal epidural abscess. The patient was managed conservatively with serial epidural needle drainage and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. She achieved complete clinical and radiological recovery without neurological sequelae. Pediatric SEA is rare, but early recognition and appropriate management are essential to prevent irreversible complications. Clinicians should remain vigilant for spinal complications of iGAS infections to optimize outcomes.	Cureus	2025 Dec	['Syrimi N', 'Maritsi D', 'Sulaj A', 'Tsolia M', 'Syngelou A']	41523551
Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem and Colistin Resistance in Isolates Causing Urinary Tract Infections at an Outpatient Setting of a Tertiary Care Hospital.	Background Increasing resistance to higher-end antibiotics like carbapenems and colistin is a great cause of concern. There is a paucity of data on the detection of carbapenem and colistin in outpatient settings. This study was to determine the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and colistin resistance in CRE at the outpatient setting of a tertiary care institute of North India. Methods A prospective study was conducted from January to December 2020. A total of 6,829 non-repetitive urine samples were cultured on cysteine lactose electrolyte-deficient (CLED) agar. Identification was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2020, using Kirby-Bauer and Vitek 2 (BioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Carbapenem-resistant isolates were screened for carbapenemase genes (bla(NDM) , bla(KPC) , bla(OXA) , bla(OXA-48) ). Colistin resistance was confirmed by broth microdilution. Results A total of 669/6829 (9.79%) urine specimens yielded significant growth, mostly in females (54.1%), less than in other studies probably due to fewer samples received because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (50.82%) of patients belonged to the early adult group (15-45 years). Most organisms were Enterobacteriaceae (509/669, 76.08%). The most common organism isolated was E. coli (56.5%) followed by K. pneumoniae (18.2%). 5.97% (40/669) isolates were carbapenem-resistant. 6.87% (35/509) of Enterobacteriaceae were carbapenem-resistant, which is less than in other studies possibly due to samples from outpatient settings. The following carbapenemase genes were detected: bla(NDM)  (18/35), bla(KPC)  (2/35), bla(OXA ) (11/35) and bla(OXA-48)  (5/35). Some isolates had co-existence of more than two carbapenemase genes. Colistin resistance in CRE was 11% which is like other studies conducted in the same tertiary centre. Comparison of resistance patterns of other antibiotics in CRE and carbapenem-sensitive Enterobacterales (CSE) group shows that fosfomycin, ticarcillin-clavulanate and tetracycline had higher sensitivity in the CRE group. Conclusion The presence of these genes in outpatient settings is worrisome. Both bla (NDM )and bla(OXA-48) resulted in higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against carbapenems. Co-presence of NDM with OXA-48-producing E. coli in urine culture. Colistin resistance in an outpatient setting is alarming. Early detection of these resistance-determinant genes by molecular methods is essential in limiting the spread of infection due to these organisms.

Impact of a Short Study Skills Course on Depressive Symptoms Among Medical Students.	Objectives The study aimed to assess the impact of a study skills course on the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms among third-year medical students. Depression in this population can affect their education and future clinical practice, making it crucial to address and explore ways to mitigate the impact of studying in medical school on depressive symptoms and mental health. Methods An experimental cohort study following two groups prospectively was conducted between January and May 2022. The Study Skills Inventory (SSI) measured study skills, while the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) assessed depressive symptoms in both the index and control groups, before and after the course. Of the 69 participants, 36 were in the index group, and 33 were in the control group. A six-session study skills course was conducted virtually via the Zoom (Zoom Communications, San Jose, CA, USA) platform due to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course incorporated a variety of teaching and learning strategies, including interactive lectures, small group discussions, educational materials, and skill-building exercises. In addition to descriptive statistics, mean ranks of the pre-post test scores of the index and control groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests, as appropriate. Results Overall, session attendance was low. No statistically significant differences in depressive symptoms or study skills were detected between the two groups, either pre- or post-intervention. Conclusion This study concluded that the study skills course did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms. Future research should evaluate similar interventions within more comprehensive curricula to assess their effects on psychological well-being.

A Public Value Crisis Model Approach to COVID-19 Outbreak Control in the Dominican Republic.	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 exposed critical vulnerabilities in health systems worldwide. The Dominican Republic faced an early and severe outbreak in Duarte Province, necessitating rapid action. The government implemented a localized ""Public Value Crisis Model,"" known as #PlanDuarte, integrating public-private collaboration, epidemiological intelligence, and community engagement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether #PlanDuarte was associated with measurable epidemiological improvements using Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA), and to examine how public value principles informed crisis governance. METHODS: We analyzed daily COVID-19 data from March to December 2020 using segmented regression with Newey-West standard errors. Duarte Province (intervention site) was compared with all other provinces (non-intervention group). Data sources included the Ministry of Public Health registry. We assessed changes in trends for daily new cases following the lockdown and the implementation of public value-driven actions. RESULTS: Prior to the intervention, Duarte experienced a significant daily increase in cases (beta1 = 0.88, p < 0.001). Following implementation, the post-intervention trend decreased significantly (beta3 = -1.63, p < 0.001), unlike the non-intervention provinces. Epidemiological improvements corresponded with increased testing, expanded hospital capacity, and strengthened intersectoral coordination. CONCLUSION: The intervention in Duarte Province was associated with reduced epidemic growth and strengthened system responsiveness. Rooted in public value theory, #PlanDuarte illustrates how coordinated, community-empowering governance structures can improve crisis outcomes. Results reflect temporal association rather than definitive causality and underscore the need for context-sensitive governance in middle-income settings."

Quantification and Analysis of Laser Peripheral Iridotomies in the United States from 2000 to 2021.	AIM: To analyze the number of laser peripheral iridotomies (LPIs) performed from 2000 to 2021 in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part B National Summary database was queried to obtain deidentified records of patients who underwent LPI between 2000 and 2021, and patients who underwent cataract surgery between 2011 and 2021. Annual total allowed services and charges were collected for CPT 66761 (LPI), and CPT 66982 and 66984 (cataract surgery). Annual inflation rates and population data were obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the World Bank. RESULTS: The number of LPIs performed increased 58.8% from 64,935 in 2000 to 1,03,113 in 2008, remained fairly constant between 2009 and 2015, and declined 35.4% from 96,495 in 2016 to 62,376 in 2021. Allowed services per 10,000 people increased 47.37% from 2.301 in 2000 to 3.391 in 2008 before declining 44.59% to 1.879 in 2021. The US population increased 17.6% over the time period. LPI average allowed charge was $311.71 in 2000, increased to $376.77 in 2007, decreased to $269.88 in 2012, remained relatively constant from 2012 to 2018, and increased from $275.47 in 2019 to $280.33 in 2021. The average allowed charge decreased 10.1%, while the rate of cumulative inflation was 53%. Total annual allowed charge decreased 13.6% from 2000 to 2021, unadjusted for inflation. CONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2021, the number of LPIs performed in the United States declined while population increased. Potential drivers include results of scientific studies that recommended early cataract surgery and observing patients with primary angle closure suspects (PACS), a shift in physician sentiment of the LPI risk-benefit ratio, and economic forces. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the decrease in LPIs in 2020 and 2021. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The number of LPIs performed in the United States declined over the last 20 years, while the population has increased. Factors, such as influential studies recommending early cataract extraction and monitoring patients without LPI, shifting doctor sentiments, and economic factors may have affected LPI rates.

Cognitive Impairment in Post-COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Neuropsychological Evaluation Study.	"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments, often termed ""brain fog,"" have emerged as prevalent sequelae among individuals recovering from COVID-19. Despite increasing recognition, systematic neuropsychological evaluation data remain limited. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted between February 2023 and December 2024 in a tertiary care neurorehabilitation center. One hundred twenty post-COVID-19 patients (mean age 44.6 +/- 11.3 years; 58.3% male) presenting with cognitive complaints at least 3 months after recovery were recruited. Patients underwent evaluation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A, TMT-B), and Digit Span Test. A control group of 60 age- and education-matched individuals without prior COVID-19 served as comparison. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Cognitive impairment (MoCA score <26) was observed in 66.7% of post-COVID-19 participants compared to 15.0% of controls (P < 0.001). Post-COVID patients showed significantly slower TMT-A (43.7 +/- 12.9 vs 31.2 +/- 9.6 sec; P < 0.001) and TMT-B times (95.8 +/- 22.4 vs 76.5 +/- 17.8 sec; P < 0.001). Working memory (Digit Span backward) was also impaired (mean score: 4.2 +/- 0.9 vs 5.3 +/- 0.8; P < 0.001). Severity of initial infection (hospitalized vs non-hospitalized) was associated with increased odds of impairment (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.22-6.74; P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficits are common in post-COVID-19 patients, particularly affecting attention, processing speed, and working memory. Structured cognitive screening and rehabilitation may be essential components of long-term COVID-19 care."

Evaluation and improvement of algorithmic fairness for COVID-19 severity classification using Explainable Artificial Intelligence-based bias mitigation.	OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the growing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for predicting disease severity, which is important for clinical decision-making and equitable resource allocation. While achieving high predictive accuracy is important, ensuring fairness in the prediction output of these models is equally important to prevent bias-driven disparities in healthcare. This study evaluates fairness in a machine learning-based COVID-19 severity classification model and proposes an Explainable AI (XAI)-based bias mitigation strategy to address sex-related bias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the Quebec Biobank, we developed an XGBoost-based multi-class classification model. Fairness was assessed using Subset Accuracy Parity Difference (SAPD) and Label-wise Equal Opportunity Difference (LEOD) metrics. Four bias mitigation strategies were implemented and evaluated: Fair Representation Learning, Fair Classifier Using Constraints, Adversarial Debiasing, and our proposed XAI-based method utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method for feature importance analysis. RESULTS: The study cohort included 1642 COVID-19 positive older adults (mean age: 77.5), balance equally between males and females. The baseline (unmitigated) classification model achieved 90.68% accuracy but exhibited a 10.11% Subset Accuracy Parity Difference between sexes, indicating a relatively large bias. The introduced XAI-based method demonstrated a better trade-off between model performance and fairness compared to existing bias mitigation methods by identifying sex-sensitive feature interactions and integrating them into the model re-training. DISCUSSION: Traditional fairness interventions often compromise accuracy to a greater extent. Our XAI-based method achieves the best balance between classification performance and bias, enhancing its clinical applicability. CONCLUSION: The XAI-driven bias mitigation intervention effectively reduces sex-based disparities in COVID-19 severity prediction without the significant accuracy loss observed in traditional methods. This approach provides a framework for developing fair and accurate clinical decision support systems for older adults, which ensures equitable care in clinical risk stratification and resource allocation.

Homelessness in pregnancy: life course factors and mental health in the context of COVID-19.	INTRODUCTION: Homelessness during pregnancy is a significant public health issue in the US that increases the risk of adverse maternal and infant mental and physical health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these risks through disruptions in health and social services, employment, and housing stability. Our study aimed to explore how early and cumulative adverse life experiences, mental health challenges, and the pandemic shaped the experience of homelessness during pregnancy. METHODS: We used ​an action-oriented approach for this qualitative exploratory study. We conducted 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews in 2022 among a sample of pregnant, postpartum, and parenting people in Washington DC who experienced homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a directed content analysis and utilized a life course perspective as the guiding analytic framework. RESULTS: We identified six themes: early family instability - childhood through adolescence, vulnerability and conflict as an emerging adult, economic precarity during adulthood, desire for intergenerational family stability and wellbeing, impacts of COVID on homelessness and housing instability for pregnant people, and mental health and housing instability during pregnancy. DISCUSSION: Findings highlight that homelessness during pregnancy reflects cumulative adversity which compound across the life course, with the potential to cause intergenerational consequences for maternal and infant health. Policies that ensure stable, safe housing during the perinatal period, integrated mental health care, and economic supports are urgently needed. We identify critical opportunities for policy and practice reforms, emphasizing the need for trauma-informed solutions using a life-course approach.

Virtual lab of artificial intelligence agents accelerating nanobody design against SARS-CoV-2 variants.	Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven research frameworks are reshaping the boundaries of biomedical discovery. The Virtual Lab exemplifies this transformation, assembling large language model (LLM) agents into coordinated scientific teams functioning as investigators, specialists, and critics. The system autonomously designed, scored, and refined nanobody candidates against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and subsequently validated them experimentally. These findings demonstrate how AI can move beyond prediction and retrieval to serve as an active collaborator in hypothesis generation, experimental design, and translational application. As technology continues to advance, the convergence of artificial intelligence and quantum computing is expected to give rise to a new era of Quantum AI enabled biomedical research. This integration will accelerate discovery speed, enhance precision, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, opening unprecedented opportunities for data-driven innovation in the life sciences.

Optimizing urban bike-sharing systems: a stochastic mathematical model for infrastructure planning.	This paper addresses the optimization of resource allocation and infrastructure planning in bike-sharing systems, particularly inspired by dynamic demand patterns as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce a stochastic mathematical model that considers varying demand scenarios to enhance system performance and resource utilization. The research objectives are to fulfill the total travel demand across scenarios and compute the network's capacity to satisfy demand, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and meeting users' diverse travel needs. The main contributions of this paper include presenting a stochastic mathematical model for bike-sharing station allocation and path network design, which optimizes resource allocation and infrastructure planning. Through a case study on the Vienna bike-sharing system, the model demonstrates practical applicability and effectiveness, offering insights for improving efficiency and service quality. The sensitivity analysis reveals that as costs for bicycle docks and station building increase, fulfilled demand decreases, emphasizing the crucial role of cost management in meeting demand efficiently.

IMPROVING HPV VACCINE RATES FOR ABORIGINAL YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN: AN INTERRUPTED TIME SERIES.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to HPV-related cancers such as cervical cancer and other cancers such as anal, vaginal, and penile cancer. HPV rarely produces symptoms and cannot be cured or treated; therefore, vaccination is essential to protect against HPV and HPV-related diseases. However, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, 'Aboriginal') people are not receiving their HPV vaccine dose, resulting in missed opportunities to be protected from HPV-related cancers. Health promotion is a critical way to empower people to take ownership over and control their health and is a core function of public health. One way to deliver health promotion is through social media platforms. In recent COVID-19 times, we have seen the effect of social media on public health messaging, both positive and harmful. In particular, Instagram influencers have had a profound impact on pro- and anti-vaccination messages. Aboriginal adolescents aged 13-15 years old have strong engagement with social media platforms. Combining co-created health promotion messages with local 'micro-Influencers' is a novel way to improve HPV vaccination rates. The overall aim of this project is to improve the rates of HPV vaccination amongst young Aboriginal people. We will achieve this through: i) co-creation of health promotion messages, ii) developing and delivering a social media campaign and iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the campaign through an interrupted time-series design. We hypothesise that the co-creation of health promotion messages with young Aboriginal people and their families and utilising the skills of micro-Influencers to engage and influence their followers will result in improvements HPV vaccination rates amongst this population.

Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone for Mitigation of Interstitial Lung Abnormalities in COVID-19 Patients: A Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Although post-COVID-19 interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are common, the use of antifibrotic agents to prevent their onset and progression is controversial. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of pirfenidone to mitigate the onset and progression of ILAs in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched literature published before July 21, 2025, from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine, Weipu, and Wanfang databases, without language limitation. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated the effect of pirfenidone on COVID-19-induced ILAs were included. Risk of bias was determined using the Revised Cochrane Randomized Trial Risk Bias Tool Version 2 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The efficacy and safety of pirfenidone for ILAs in COVID-19 were analyzed by Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: Eight studies were included, comprising 335 patients in pirfenidone treatment groups and 302 controls. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. Pirfenidone significantly decreased chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) scores during early- and late-stage COVID-19 and significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 s, especially in late-stage COVID-19. Pirfenidone treatment was associated with statistically nonsignificant trends toward improved forced vital capacity and decreased all-cause mortality. Furthermore, HRCT scores, pulmonary function, and inflammatory cytokine levels following pirfenidone treatment were superior to those obtained after glucocorticoid therapy. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in the pirfenidone than the control group, but no serious adverse events or fatalities occurred. CONCLUSION: Pirfenidone therapy may mitigate ILAs and preserve pulmonary function among survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, pirfenidone exhibited acceptable safety and tolerability profiles.	Canadian respiratory journal	2026	['Zhang Z', 'Fang X', 'Gao J', 'Sun H', 'Xu T', 'Wang J']	41522210
Assessing the Impact of Colchicine on Pulmonary Fibrosis Using Imaging in Patients With Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia.	OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially those with high inflammatory indicators. We aimed to investigate the 15-month follow-up clinical outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with colchicine and to evaluate its potential in preventing post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis. METHOD: This study, beginning with a retrospective analysis of 1489 selected patients, and a follow-up assessment of 155 patients conducted 15 months after hospital discharge. This study included 90 patients presenting with COVID-19 pneumonia with severity ranging from moderate to severe who were treated with colchicine alongside standard care, and 65 patients who did not receive colchicine were included in the control group to serve as a comparator. Patients who received colchicine treatment were included in Group 1, and those that did not in Group 2. RESULTS: From admission to the 15-month follow-up, patients receiving colchicine exhibited a significant regression in chest CT abnormalities when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, 65.6% (n = 59) of the colchicine group experienced symptomatic improvement, significantly higher than 35.4% (n = 23) in the control group (p < 0.05). Ninety patients who received colchicine treatment had Stage 3, 4, or 5, and only 28 had Stage 3, 4, or 5 pulmonary fibrosis at the end of 15 months. After 15 months of follow-up, all 20 patients initially classified as Stage 5 who received colchicine remained at Stage 5 pulmonary fibrosis, whereas in the control group, 2 patients (3.1%) were fibrosis-free, and the others presented with Stage 1 (n = 23; 35.4%), Stage 3 (n = 23; 35.4%), Stage 4 (n = 9; 13.8%), or Stage 5 (n = 8; 12.3%) pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that colchicine therapy might reduce pulmonary fibrosis progression in individuals affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinicians should consider colchicine treatment to prevent pulmonary fibrosis.	Canadian respiratory journal	2026	['Ayhan Albayrak G', 'Bardakci MI', 'Temel U']	41522209
Inhalation & intravenous: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes therapy strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome in a murine model.	BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex syndrome characterized by acute diffuse lung injury and progressive respiratory failure, caused by various intra- and extra-pulmonary factors. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of ARDS, posing a tremendous threat to human health due to its high mortality rate and lack of effective therapeutic drugs. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exo) have been considered a new hope for the treatment of ARDS due to their potent immunomodulatory characteristics. Although multiple studies have demonstrated their efficacy and safety, the differential therapeutic effects of various administration routes and doses remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the administration route of MSC-exo for ARDS treatment, with the goal of maximizing therapeutic benefits and providing valuable clinical insights. METHODS: This study aims to establish an ARDS disease model by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male C57/BL6 mice. Subsequently, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell exosomes will be administered via three methods: inhalation, tail vein injection, and combination therapy (inhalation combined with tail vein injection). Following the establishment of the mouse ARDS model via intratracheal instillation of LPS, the animals were randomly divided into seven groups based on the timing and dosage of the treatment administration. Samples were harvested at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after modeling. The assessments included RNA transcriptome sequencing, cytokine levels in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood oxygen saturation, histopathological staining, and survival analysis. RESULTS: Compared to nebulized exosomes alone, dual-route administration significantly improved respiratory function, as evidenced by prolonged expiratory and inspiratory times and increased minute ventilation (P</=0.05). Furthermore, it decreased the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the blood (P=0.01, P=0.041). Compared to intravenous exosomes alone, dual-route administration produced broader improvements. It significantly enhanced lung function by prolonging expiratory time (P=0.01), inspiratory time (P=0.004), and increasing minute ventilation (P=0.02). Additionally, it suppressed inflammation by lowering IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P=0.01) and reduced the death of type II alveolar epithelial cells (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The dual-route administration of umbilical cord MSC-exo is more effective in controlling the inflammatory response and alleviating lung injury in LPS-induced ARDS animal models. Inhalation rapidly alleviates pulmonary inflammation with a smaller dose, while intravenous injection better manages the systemic inflammation. This dual-route approach holds promise as a novel ARDS treatment strategy.

Association between eosinophil counts and outcomes of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in elderly asthma patients: a prospective cohort study.	"BACKGROUND: Given effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the respiratory system and epidemiological burden of asthma worldwide, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in asthma patients caused reasonable concern to be a ""dangerous"" combination in early pandemic. This is especially pertinent to elderly patients with asthma since older age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, is associated with more serious complications of COVID-19 and higher mortality. Blood eosinopenia occurs as a part of the total cytopenia at the early stage of severe COVID-19 due to an effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the immunity and severe inflammation. Therefore, blood cell count monitoring could be useful for the diagnosis and outcome prediction in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate a relationship between blood eosinophil count and outcomes of COVID-associated lung injury in elderly patients with asthma. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study involving elderly patients with asthma (>60 years of age, n=131). All patients were admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 from October 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. Those patients who completed their hospital treatment (were discharged or died) by December, 30, 2021, were enrolled in the study. All the patients were previously diagnosed with asthma according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, typical clinical symptoms, and radiological signs of multifocal pneumonia. Survived patients were followed up by weekly phone calls for 90 days after discharge. The complete blood count was measured in the whole blood samples obtained at admission. Hazard ratio was calculated using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: In total, 131 patients were enrolled in the study. Eighty-six patients survived, 30 patients died in the hospital, and 15 patients died post-discharge. Common independent predictors of death were the Charlson Comorbidity Index and eosinopenia. Survived patients had higher blood eosinophil count compared to patients who died in the hospital or post-discharge (P=0.001 and P=0.04, respectively). The cut-off eosinophil count was estimated as 100 cells/L; higher eosinophil count was seen in 24% of survivors and in none of non-survivors (P=0.002 and P=0.04, respectively). The absolute eosinophil count was a significant predictor of in-hospital death [odds ratio (OR), 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.84; P=0.002] and death post-discharge (OR, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65-0.95; P=0.01). Median survival, in-hospital and post-discharge, was shorter in patients with eosinophil count </=100 cells/L (P<0.001 and P=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Blood eosinophil count could be used as a prognostic marker of outcome in elderly patients with asthma and COVID-associated lung injury. Eosinophil level </=100 cells/microL could be used as a threshold for predicting poor outcome, both in-hospital and 90-day post-discharge."

Novel insights into diagnosis and management of hyperreactivity: a narrative review.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hyperreactivity (HR) refers to an exaggerated biological response to a given stimulus that is within the normal physiological range, resulting from a lowered activation threshold of the involved system or effector cells. It commonly occurs after surgery, lung transplantation, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection but lacks a unified concept and systematic understanding. This review aims to elucidate the concept, mechanisms, and disease spectrum of HR as an independent clinical entity, systematically explore its roles in postoperative conditions, lung transplantation, and COVID-19, and develop a biomarker-based hierarchical management framework, thereby providing a new paradigm for its precise recognition and intervention. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for literature published from January 1, 1968, to November 1, 2025, including reviews, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies, human or animal studies related to HR mechanisms or clinical phenotypes, while excluding non-peer-reviewed materials such as case reports and conference abstracts. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: This study first proposes that HR arises from a four-dimensional imbalance across the nervous, endocrine, immune, and microenvironmental systems, characterized by thoroughness, early onset/persistence, and individual variability. The mechanisms underlying HR in postoperative, transplant-related, and COVID-19 conditions are systematically summarized, and a hierarchical, biomarker-based management framework is developed, highlighting the need for marker validation and trajectory modeling. CONCLUSIONS: HR represents an independent clinical entity that transcends traditional disease boundaries. This review provides a new paradigm for its precise recognition and intervention and is expected to advance the conceptual and practical development of this field. Future research, clinical practice, and policy formulation should be individualized and mechanism-driven.

Early assessment of myocardial injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 using a two-stage deep learning framework based on non-contrast chest computed tomography.	BACKGROUND: Risk stratification is particularly important for the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly regarding myocardial injury (MI). Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) is useful for diagnosing lung injury, but its potential for one-stop evaluation of MI remains unclear. This study aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) framework for the one-step prediction of MI in COVID-19 patients using non-contrast chest CT. This approach seeks to enable early MI screening, direct high-risk patients toward further diagnostic tests, and optimize the allocation of medical resources. METHODS: A group of 453 patients with COVID-19, including 230 patients with MI and 223 patients without MI, were retrospectively recruited. A two-stage DL framework was developed to first segment the left ventricle (LV) in the non-contrast chest CT images using fully convolutional networks with a ResNet-101 backbone (FCN-ResNet-101) module and then classify the status of MI using densely connected convolutional network with the structure type of 121 (DenseNet-121) module. The framework was trained in a training-validation dataset of 413 patients (MI or non-MI) with a cross-validation approach, and evaluated in a testing dataset of 40 patients. RESULTS: The proposed DL framework accurately obtained the segmentations of LV in non-contrast chest CT images with an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.8041, an accuracy (ACC) of 0.9949, and a Dice coefficient of 0.8672. Based on the segmentation, the DL framework further accurately determined MI status and obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8618 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8049-0.9187], an ACC of 0.7763, a sensitivity (SEN) of 0.8750, a specificity (SPE) of 0.6071, and an F1 score of 0.8317. CONCLUSIONS: DL could determine the status of MI in non-contrast chest CT images of patients with COVID-19, providing one-stop convenience for early screening of MI.

Emotional Response Patterns and COVID-19 Vaccine Intentions & Uptake in Two Approximated Nationally Representative U.S. Samples: A Latent Profile Analysis Replication Study.	"Despite the role that emotions have in influencing health behaviors, limited research has systematically investigated their role in COVID-19 vaccination decisions compared to the role of cognitions in vaccine behavior. This study aimed to (a) identify groups of adults with similar emotional responses to COVID-19 via latent profile analysis and (b) examine differences in vaccine intentions and uptake between emotion groups. Data were drawn from two samples designed to approximate nationally representative samples of US adults. The first survey (N = 3,853) was administered between December 2020 and January 2021, amid emergency authorization for COVID-19 vaccination. The second survey (N = 3,528) was administered in August 2021, alongside FDA COVID-19 vaccination approval. Five emotion profiles were replicated across the samples: ""Emotionally Unaffected,"" ""Contempt,"" ""Low Emotional Effect,"" ""Moderate Emotional Effect,"" and ""High Emotional Effect,"" which were differentially associated with vaccine intentions and behavior. Negative emotions varied in their effects: Participants in the ""Contempt"" group were most likely to reject the vaccine (Sample 1) and remain unvaccinated (Sample 2), whereas those in the ""High Emotional Effect"" group were less likely to be vaccine hesitant (Sample 1) and had the highest vaccination rates (Sample 2). Concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine also varied by emotion group among unvaccinated participants (Sample 2). Taken together, these novel findings highlight the need for emotion-responsive public health messaging. We suggest that COVID-19 vaccine communication strategies should be tailored to address people's distinct emotional responses, including those driven by anger and disgust, to improve the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns."

From Trust to Skepticism: Longitudinal Qualitative Insights on Uncertainties in COVID-19 Vaccine Messaging Among Trial-Engaged Participants Across the United States.	Mass vaccination emerged as a key public health strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, greater attention is needed to understand the shifting dynamics of vaccine messaging amid rampant uncertainty across the United States, including its impact on vaccine uptake behaviors over time. Our study presented a unique opportunity to longitudinally explore how perceived uncertainties in COVID-19 vaccine messaging shaped vaccine uptake behaviors among participants enrolled in a remote, nationwide COVID-19 trial in the United States. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually across two timepoints (T1: December 2020 to March 2021, n = 19; T2: January to February 2022, n = 11). Analysis was guided by immersion crystallization; an inductive and deductive approach to identifying themes and the relationships between them. Most participants (aged 32-74) resided in California (T1: 58%, T2: 45%) and self-identified as white (T1: 63%; T2: 73%) and/or cisgender women (T1: 63%; T2: 55%). All participants expressed interest in the COVID-19 vaccine at T1, among which 21% received their first dose as members of priority groups. By T2, all participants obtained the primary COVID-19 vaccine series, and 73% received a booster. Key themes included: (1) self-efficacy in the absence of cohesive information; (2) shifting guidelines heightened perceived barriers and uncertainties; and (3) unresolved messaging fueled skepticism and reduced trust in public health. Findings underscore how logistical and scientific uncertainties can be detrimental to long-term vaccine uptake, albeit acting in different ways. Communicating uncertainties necessitates iterative, public participation to advance health and scientific literacy, mitigate vaccine skepticism, and sustain vaccine uptake behaviors over time.

Lifestyle and health behaviour changes of ageing Finnish women during early COVID-19 restrictions.	AIMS: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following lockdown enforced substantial lifestyle changes in people's everyday lives. This study aimed to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 restrictions on the ageing women's mental, social and physical well-being. METHODS: Data were collected through two postal questionnaires. Baseline data were obtained in May-June 2019, prior to the pandemic. A follow-up survey was mailed to 760 eligible participants in August-September 2020; 571 women (75.1%) responded, forming the final cohort. The cohort comprised community-dwelling women born between 1932 and 1941 (mean age 82.5 years). Both surveys assessed health, lifestyle, mood, sleep, and technology use, with the follow-up including pandemic-related items. RESULTS: Dietary habits improved with increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, and decreased intake of sweets, pastries, alcohol and meat. Sleep quality and perceived sufficiency remained stable, although nighttime awakenings declined (p=0.023). Social interactions decreased for 43.6% of respondents, yet 20.2% reported receiving more support. Functional capacity deteriorated significantly, with reduced ability to climb several floors, run 100 m and cycle (all p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early lockdown was associated with both positive and negative outcomes. Favourable changes included healthier diets and stable sleep quality. Despite reduced face-to-face contact, perceived social support improved for some participants. However, physical functioning declined, underscoring the need to maintain mobility during prolonged restrictions.

Poly(sarcosine) Lipid Synthesis From CO(2)-Based Sarcosine-N-Carboxyanhydride.	Polymer lipids (PLs) are an essential component for the stability of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for gene delivery. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based lipids are the current gold standard. However, they are suspected to be responsible for rare adverse reactions to the LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, alternative PLs are being intensively investigated. A particularly promising alternative are poly(sarcosine) (PSar)-based lipids. However, one significant bottleneck of pSar-based biomaterials is the synthesis of the monomer sarcosine-N-carboxyanhydride (Sar-NCA). Current methods rely on highly toxic di- or triphosgene to obtain the monomer directly from the amino acid sarcosine. Herein, we present a phosgene-free, CO(2)-based route to Sar-NCA in gram scale and excellent purity, suitable for the subsequent living polymerization to pSar. Furthermore, we used the obtained pSar for the synthesis of pSar lipids suitable for LNP preparation. Due to its low toxicity and simplicity, the CO(2)-based Sar-NCA synthesis has great potential to become an attractive alternative to current monomer synthesis pathways.

Lifestyle Factors and Current Alcohol Consumption Among Japanese Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study.	BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced drinking behaviors in minors by disrupting daily routines and increasing psychosocial stress, although alcohol use among Japanese adolescents has declined in recent years. We aimed to clarify the relationships between current alcohol consumption and lifestyle factors during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the 2021 Lifestyle Survey of Adolescents, a nationwide survey conducted in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 15 549 junior and senior high school students (7645 boys and 7904 girls) were included. Current alcohol consumption was defined as drinking on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between current alcohol consumption and lifestyle factors, including irregular sleep patterns, irregular dietary habits, and increased screen time. Sex-stratified analyses and interaction tests were also performed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current alcohol consumption was 2.1%, with slightly higher rates among boys (2.2%) than girls (2.0%). Current alcohol consumption was significantly associated with irregular sleep patterns (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.95) and irregular dietary habits (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.40). An association with increased screen time was also observed (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.00-1.69), particularly among boys. A significant interaction by sex was detected for irregular sleep patterns (p for interaction = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption among Japanese adolescents was associated with irregular sleep and dietary habits and, among boys, with increased screen time. These findings highlight the importance of promoting regular routines and addressing lifestyle-related risks to prevent current alcohol consumption among adolescents during public health crises.

The Effect of Voluntary Staying at Home on Japanese Female Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic.	In Japan, female suicide increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated how pandemic-related home confinement affected female suicide. We employed a shift-share instrumental variable design to assess whether differential exposure to the pandemic caused changes in suicide incidence. We found that suicide increased among females under 20 years of age as more people stayed at home. Counterfactual analyses showed that at least 35% of these suicides were attributed to home confinement. Our results suggest that a substantial part of the suicide increase among young females was driven by lifestyle changes during the pandemic.

The intersection of health inequalities and COVID-19: Evidence from National Health Insurance Big Data in South Korea.	Health inequalities persist along lines of income and wealth, shaped by unequal access to healthcare, differences in health behaviors, and pre-existing chronic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic further put families in Korea under health strain and worsened their health outcomes. This study investigates how pre-existing socioeconomic disparities intersect with health outcomes. Using the national administrative health big data provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we employ logistic regression models for 10,459,043 randomly sampled cases from a total of more than 34 million registered positive cases in the country. We specifically examine whether and to what extent individuals from lower income backgrounds with positive cases are more or less likely to experience negative health outcomes. Our findings reveal that individuals from higher income backgrounds are less likely to experience negative health outcomes compared to the lowest income group, including hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, confidence interval [CI] = 0.44, 0.46), severe illness (OR = 0.70, CI = 0.61, 0.81), and fatalities (OR = 0.40, CI = 0.38, 0.41). Furthermore, our subsample analyses based on various demographic characteristics consistently showed that individuals from higher income backgrounds face a lower risk of adverse health outcomes. These results indicate that disadvantaged individuals are disproportionately affected by the health crisis, deepening health inequities. This paper emphasizes the need for targeted public policies.

Framing the Coronavirus Epidemic Through Intertextual Practices: A Comparative Study of Japanese and South Korean Press Reports.	This study deconstructs the way in which journalists in two lesser-studied contexts framed a major health crisis through the lens of intertextuality. Based on a corpus of English-language newspaper reports from Japan and South Korea from 2020 to 2022, the study explicates the way in which the risks, urgency, and gravity of the COVID-19 crisis are talked into being, amplified, or downplayed through the complex interaction of the quoted and reporter voices. The findings reveal that in both settings, quotations are strategically interwoven to serve four rhetorical functions: reporting facts, distancing, deauthorizing, and providing a personal touch. Despite similar journalistic standards, variation is observed in terms of the types of sources deferred to and the functions the voices opted for. Such differences are attributed to the changing nature of the socio-political factors in the two countries.	Health communication	2026 Jan 11	['Traiboot N', 'Kim SY', 'Chaemsaithong K']	41521454
You Have These Antibodies Waitin' to Pop Off: Black Amplification Rhetorics in Tyler Perry's COVID-19 Vaccine Special.	"This article interrogates COVID-19 Vaccine and the Black Community: A Tyler Perry Special, a health communication program that addressed vaccine hesitancy in the Black community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using critical race theory (CRT) and amplification rhetoric, we, two Black scholars, analyze how the program leveraged culturally resonant storytelling, African American Vernacular English (AAVE), and the influence of Tyler Perry to challenge medical mistrust and race-based structural inequities. While acknowledging that the Black experience is not monolithic, the special reframes vaccine hesitancy in the Black community as ""healthy hesitation,"" and centers collective Black experiences to critique historical and contemporary medical racism. Additionally, anchored in Black epistemologies, the special employs platforms like BET and YouTube to connect with audiences in culturally meaningful ways. In turn, this study demonstrates the power of culturally tailored health communication to build trust and offers insights into health communication strategies for members of the Black community. The study also illuminates implications at the intersections of pop culture, race, culture, and health communication."	Health communication	2026 Jan 11	['Hawkins D', 'Simon-Roberts S']	41521405
mRNA-Encoded antibodies as a next-generation therapeutic paradigm: a rapid and adaptive platform for the prevention and treatment of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases - A critical review.	Messenger RNA (mRNA)-encoded antibodies represent a transformative therapeutic platform with the potential to rapidly combat emerging infectious diseases by enabling in situ expression of potent neutralizing antibodies directly in the patient's body. Unlike conventional monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies, which rely on labor-intensive and time-consuming cell culture production, mRNA-encoded antibodies offer a faster, scalable, and cell-free approach that bypasses protein purification and cold-chain constraints. This strategy has demonstrated considerable promise during the COVID-19 pandemic, where Moderna's mRNA-1940, an mRNA-based neutralizing antibody targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, entered preclinical and early-phase trials within months of viral emergence, underscoring the potential for rapid response in outbreak settings. The platform leverages advances in nucleoside-modified mRNA, codon optimization, and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems to achieve transient, high-level expression of functional antibodies with reduced innate immune activation. Beyond COVID-19, mRNA-encoded antibody approaches have been explored in preclinical models of Zika virus, Ebola virus, and rabies, where a single intramuscular dose provided prophylactic and therapeutic benefits in animal models. As the world faces recurrent viral threats, the development of mRNA-encoded antibodies as a plug-and-play system offers a compelling, adaptable, and clinically feasible strategy for infectious disease preparedness. This review explores the mechanistic foundation, delivery technologies, translational progress, case studies, safety considerations, and future clinical potential of mRNA-encoded antibodies in combating both pandemic and endemic infections.

Geographic access to emergency pediatric dental care during COVID-19: a population-based study from Israel.	BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems, particularly affecting specialized services like pediatric dental care. This study examined geographic disparities in emergency dental service access for children during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Israel. METHODS: We analyzed data from a major healthcare provider serving 25% of Israel's population, comparing 6,024 emergency dental visits of children under 12 across three time periods: pre-pandemic (March-May 2019), first lockdown (March-May 2020), and post-lockdown (March-May 2021). Using spatial analysis methods, we evaluated the distribution and accessibility of emergency dental services across four main geographic regions through metrics including Load Ratio (LR), Geographic Availability Index (GAI), and Rate of Change in Service Utilization (ROCSU). RESULTS: During the lockdown, emergency visits decreased by 40.2% compared to the pre-pandemic period, with significant regional variations ranging from 31.2% in the Northern region to 44.8% in the Central region. The mean age of children seeking emergency care during lockdown (6.2 years) was significantly lower than in both pre-pandemic (7.1 years) and post-lockdown periods (6.8 years). Analysis revealed substantial regional disparities in service burden, with the highest Load Ratio in the Central region (1.86) and lowest in the Northern region (1.24), despite the Central region having the highest Geographic Availability Index (2.46). The Jerusalem area had the highest proportion of invasive treatments (40.4%) and swelling/abscess cases (22.4%). Ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods demonstrated distinct utilization patterns, with a lower decrease in emergency visits (29.8-36.8%) compared to the national average (40.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified significant geographic inequities in emergency dental care access during crisis periods, with a paradoxical relationship between service availability and utilization across regions. Our analysis suggests that emergency dental service planning should incorporate strategic facility placement to minimize travel barriers, consideration of population-specific utilization patterns, and balanced resource allocation that maintains proportional service capacity across diverse geographic contexts. These findings provide important insights for health system preparedness to ensure equitable access to essential pediatric dental services during future crises.

Characterizing Neuro-PASC outcome with the mobile Neuro-COVID recovery care companion application.	"BACKGROUND: Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), affects 14 million people in the US. Neurologic manifestations of PASC (Neuro-PASC) are particularly debilitating. However, the evolution of these symptoms and factors associated with recovery are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize Neuro-PASC symptom evolution using a mobile phone application and assess user experience. METHODS: The Neuro-COVID Recovery Care Companion (NCRCC) mobile application consists of questionnaires integrated within Northwestern Medicine's online MyChart platform which interfaces with the electronic medical record. Neuro-PASC patients completed daily surveys of twelve Neuro-PASC symptoms and their perceived percent recovery compared to their pre-COVID baseline. Patients also completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) quality-of-life (QoL) surveys and NIH toolbox cognitive assessments at baseline and at 3-month follow up. Participants were retrospectively classified as ""Improvers"" or ""Non-Improvers"" based on the slope and range of their percent subjective recovery. RESULTS: Data from 63 participants presenting an average of 12.7 months after symptom onset were analyzed, including 27 (42.9%) Improvers and 36 (57.1%) Non-Improvers. Fewer women were Improvers (50% vs 75.7%; p = 0.04). Multiple correspondence analysis showed that patients presenting with a constellation of anosmia, dysgeusia, and a lack of insomnia (p = 0.023) were less likely Improvers. Improvers had more fluctuations in their subjective recovery than Non-Improvers with greater mean variance (7.01 vs 3.79; p = 0.0004) and positive recovery slope (5.84 vs 0; p < 0.0001). There were no differences in QoL and cognition at initial assessment, but Improvers showed a trend toward increased processing speed and decreased sleep disturbance after 3 months. Both groups found the NCRCC application easy-to-use, useful, and satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal previously unrecognized fluctuations in subjective recovery of Neuro-PASC, and that women and patients presenting with anosmia and dysgeusia are less likely to improve one year from COVID-19 onset. We found broad alterations in QoL in both groups suggesting that strategies to reduce sleep disturbance and improve cognition may contribute to subjective improvement. Our results suggest similar mobile applications may benefit patients with other ill-defined chronic diseases, by equipping and empowering them on their often windy road to recovery."

Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lesions in CT scans using attention U-net with hybrid loss functions.	The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe, presenting significant public health challenges. Biomedical imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT), are vital for detecting and monitoring diseases. Accurately segmenting pneumonia lesions in CT scans is essential for diagnosing COVID-19 and assessing the severity of the disease. However, low-contrast infected regions pose a major challenge for automated segmentation methods. In this paper, we present an accessible deep learning framework for the automatic segmentation of COVID-19-infected regions. This framework integrates Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing with an Attention U-Net model trained using a hybrid Dice-Tversky loss. It is supported by extensive data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. We evaluated our approach on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. Our results achieved a Dice score of 0.83, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.71, and an accuracy of 99.74%. To enhance the interpretability of our deep learning model, we applied Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and highlight its potential as a practical tool for medical imaging applications.

Changes in the Epidemiology of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus During 2020-2022 Relative to the Pre-COVID-19 Pandemic Period (2017-2020) From Systematic Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance in South Africa.	BACKGROUND: Nonpharmaceutical interventions, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, affected the transmission of other respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Systematically collected respiratory illness surveillance data and consistent case definitions were used to describe changes in influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated outpatient visits and hospitalisations in South Africa during the first 3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic relative to a pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (2017-2019). RESULTS: In 2020, influenza circulation almost ceased. In 2021 an out-of-season circulation was observed with a return to prepandemic timing, albeit with a higher peak in 2022. During the pandemic period, influenza-associated influenza-like illness (ILI) was more common in those aged >/= 5 years compared to < 6 months. Patients with influenza-associated severe respiratory illness (SRI) were less likely to be >/= 45 years versus < 6 months and less likely to be admitted to ICU (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.8). RSV circulation declined at the start of the pandemic, with an out-of-season spring resurgence in 2020 followed by a return to prepandemic timing in 2021 and a higher peak in 2022. During the pandemic, compared to the prepandemic period, patients with RSV-associated SRI were more likely to be aged 1-4 years (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8) versus < 6 months and less likely to be admitted to ICU (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8). CONCLUSION: We report low levels of influenza circulation and out-of-season RSV circulation in 2020 with changes in the age distribution of cases and risk of ICU admission. Return to prepandemic timing was earlier for RSV, with higher seasonal peaks for influenza-associated ILI and RSV-associated SRI in 2022.

Infection-related mortality in children in two European countries, 2015 - 2023: an interrupted time-series analysis.	BACKGROUND: Infections remain a leading cause of childhood mortality. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) implemented during COVID-19 pandemic altered the circulation of communicable pathogens. We aimed to assess how these changes affected paediatric infection-related mortality. METHODS: We conducted a population-based interrupted time-series analysis using national data from France and Switzerland (2015 to 2023), including deaths among individuals < 18 years. Monthly infection-related mortality was analysed using quasi-Poisson regression models seasonally adjusted. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were calculated to compare infection-related mortality among birth cohorts exposed to NPI or post-NPI periods versus pre-NPI cohorts. RESULTS: Among 32,619 paediatric deaths during the study period, 8272 were related to an infection. During the NPI period, infection-related mortality declined by 16% (95% CI: -23% to -7%), corresponding to an estimated reduction of 221 (95% CI: 90 to 371) deaths. Compared to pre-NPI birth cohorts, 2019 and 2020 cohorts had significantly lower infection-related MRR (0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98 and 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: The reduction in paediatric infection-related deaths during the NPI period underscores the ongoing burden of preventable paediatric mortality and suggests that targeted preventive strategies may sustainably reduce infection-related deaths beyond pandemic settings.

Spontaneous Intracranial Hemorrhage in Brazil: Trends, Seasonality, Pandemic Disruption, and Cost Burden.	BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is a severe stroke subtype with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This study evaluated national trends in sICH hospitalizations in Brazil from 2017 to 2022, focusing on seasonal variation, neurosurgical access, financial burden, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis using DataSUS, Brazil's public health database, including all hospitalizations for ICD-10 codes I61 and I62 from January 2017 to December 2022. Time-series methods (STL decomposition, Chow test, CUSUM, ADF, and Mann-Kendall) assessed temporal trends, seasonality, and structural changes. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, neurosurgical procedures, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs. RESULTS: A total of 114,030 sICH hospitalizations occurred (mean: 16,497/year). In-hospital mortality was 25%, totaling over 28,000 deaths. A significant structural break occurred in March 2020 (Chow test: p<0.001), aligning with the pandemic onset. Admissions showed a sustained upward trend (CUSUM: p=0.002). Seasonal variation was evident, with peaks between May-September, confirmed by the ADF test (p<0.001) and 12-month autocorrelation (rho=0.41). Neurosurgical access declined (11% to 8.8%). Decompressive craniectomy was performed in 3.6% of all admissions (21% of all surgeries). Conversely, neuroendoscopy was utilized 0.2% of cases. Mean LOS decreased slightly from 10.2 to 9.4 days. Total hospitalization costs surged by 54%. CONCLUSIONS: The rising incidence, costs, and seasonal nature of sICH highlight a growing burden on the Brazilian public system. Current trends suggest demographic aging is outpacing prevention efforts, while the heavy reliance on decompressive techniques reveals a critical gap in the adoption of minimally invasive surgical options.

Static and Dynamic Scoring Systems for Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 in a Korean Cohort.	OBJECTIVES: Persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, long COVID) remain a major public-health concern. We developed a data-driven definition and static and dynamic PASC scoring systems in a multicenter, prospective-retrospective observational cohort across 12 South Korean institutions. METHODS: Adults enrolled December 2022-March 2025 were followed up to 24 months; 8,761 were recruited (7,208 infected; 1,553 controls) and 4,668 met analysis criteria (4,388 infected; 280 controls). Using participant-reported symptoms, surveys, and laboratory data, we identified nine symptoms robustly associated with PASC, with anosmia/ageusia and fatigue most influential. RESULTS: A static score integrating indicators observed within 24 months yielded an optimal threshold of 13, classifying 19% of infected participants and 4% of controls as PASC positive. A dynamic score tracking six-month intervals showed symptom burdens peaking at 0-5 months post-infection and declining thereafter; at the same threshold, 33% of infected participants were classified as PASC positive, reflecting temporal fluctuation. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish a quantitative definition of PASC and introduce a dynamic scoring framework to identify and monitor PASC, supporting future clinical research and practice.

Wastewater-based epidemiology of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in six cities of Spain: consumption patterns, seasonal trends, and the role of refined correction factors.	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) pharmaceuticals are one of the most widely used drugs worldwide. Their consumption in Spain experienced an increase from 2020 due to the global pandemic COVID-19, according to prescription packaging sales. However, many of these pharmaceutical products are over-the-counter or not all of the amount sold is consumed. Therefore, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was applied to provide objective and real-time information on their consumption. Seven pharmaceuticals were measured in untreated wastewater collected during one week between December 2020 and December 2021 from seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in different Spanish cities. The samples were analysed using an analytical methodology based on solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with prior derivatization. The concentrations found were converted into population normalised daily consumption considering the daily flow rate, population and correction factors. Refined correction factors have been obtained by a systematic review of all accessible studies, considering the excretion factors of each substance and their stability in the sewer system. The results showed that pharmaceutical consumption was similar in the different WWTPs, with paracetamol, ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid being the most consumed with mean values of 7, 41 and 12g/day/1000 inhabitants, respectively. The estimated NSAID consumption (MD), derived from wastewater analysis, aligned with the dispensing values (DCV), except for ibuprofen and diclofenac showing an overestimation of consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the predominant days of the week for each compound. In addition, an increase in consumption was observed in the New Year's Eve week. Overall, these findings demonstrate that WBE provides a reliable and complementary approach for assessing real NSAID consumption patterns in the population.

Analysis of social problems for discharge in acute care hospitalization.	INTRODUCTION: Patients who remain hospitalized due to the absence of adequate social support for discharge represent a growing challenge in an aging society where traditional family care networks are increasingly weakened. METHODS: We conducted a study in an acute care hospital in southern Spain, focusing on inpatients referred to the Social Work Department in whom social problems were identified as barriers to discharge (SPD). Data were reviewed from 2006 onwards, as well as across two 24-month periods: before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 2288 discharges with SPD were analyzed. From 2006 to 2024, the number of beds occupied by patients with SPD increased by an average of 0.62 beds per day each year. The rise was particularly marked in 2022 and 2024, when 1.3% of all hospital discharges were delayed due to SPD, equivalent to 11 beds occupied daily. Internal Medicine was the specialty with the highest proportion of patients with SPD: 4%. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital stays prolonged by social problems represent a substantial burden and show a clear upward trend. The underlying causes are multifactorial, mainly related to social circumstances and the clinical complexity of patients.

From crisis to clarity: tackling the sampling strategy challenge in airport wastewater surveillance during COVID-19.	Wastewater surveillance at airports has gained interest as a tool for early pathogen detection, but current evidence remains largely feasibility-focused and provides limited guidance on where sampling efforts should be prioritised. In this study, we go beyond feasibility assessments and present a comparative framework for evaluating wastewater-based genomic surveillance at airports. From January to April 2023, wastewater samples were collected at Frankfurt and Berlin airports from single aircraft, lavatory trucks, a sewer combining aircraft and airfield wastewater, and an airport terminal. Viral RNA was concentrated and extracted, followed by short-read amplicon sequencing, digital PCR quantification, and variant annotation with SnpEff. Sequencing success and genome coverage varied by sample type. Aircraft wastewater showed variable coverage (median 20.2-52.1%) due to low SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, while coverage from airport terminal wastewater was consistently high (median: 99.3%). Terminal wastewater exhibited the highest mutation diversity, with 143-286 mutations per sample (grab vs composite). Notably, >95% of clinically known mutations were detected in the wastewater at least one week before clinical reporting, and over 9350 previously unreported mutations were identified-highlighting the early-warning potential of airport wastewater surveillance. These results demonstrate that differences in wastewater matrix and sampling location strongly influence genomic information yield. Wastewater surveillance can complement clinical surveillance and should be considered as part of broader global health monitoring. The framework established here offers replicable guidance for other transportation hubs and public health authorities seeking to strengthen early detection capabilities and pandemic preparedness.

Trends in the diagnostic prevalence of cannabis-related disorders and co-occurring psychiatric disorders in adolescents: analysis of German health insurance data from 2013 to 2022.	Cannabis use can have detrimental effects on adolescents' mental health, often co-occurring with child and adolescent psychiatric disorders (CAPD). This study assessed diagnostic prevalence trends in cannabis-related disorders and co-occurring diagnosed CAPD in adolescents receiving outpatient treatment in Germany. Outpatient claims data from the national public health insurance system, covering almost 4 million children and adolescents, were assessed for diagnostic prevalence of cannabis-related disorders (ICD-10 diagnoses F12.X) in insurees aged 12 to 17 years for the years 2013-22, stratified by age group and sex. In addition, the diagnostic prevalence of co-occurring CAPD during the year 2022 was evaluated. From 2013 to 2022, the diagnostic prevalence of cannabis-related disorders among German adolescents utilizing outpatient services increased from 0.08% to 0.10% (+22.4%), with a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and a higher diagnostic prevalence in older adolescents. Up to 14 years of age, the diagnostic prevalence of cannabis-related disorders was distributed evenly among males and females, while from age 15 onwards, the diagnostic prevalence was higher in males. Overall, 78.3% of adolescents diagnosed with cannabis-related disorders had at least one co-occurring CAPD diagnosis in 2022. Most common co-occurring conditions were depressive disorders, conduct disorders, adjustment disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, and anxiety disorders. Co-occurring depression was particularly often diagnosed, underscoring the urgent need for integrated treatment approaches addressing both disorders simultaneously in this age group.

Association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection & clinical outcomes in infants: A multicentric retrospective cohort study in India.	Background & objectives The effects of COVID-19 on neonatal and perinatal outcomes and infant development in low- and middle-income countries have not been well studied. Our study aimed to explore the effect of maternal COVID-19 infection on pregnancy, neonatal outcomes, and development of infants. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study on women exposed to and not exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and their infants (exposed and comparison cohort, respectively). Data were collected through hospital records and interview of mothers. Outcomes included stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, admission to special newborn care unit (SNCU) and attainment of age-appropriate developmental milestones till one year of age. We conducted propensity score matching analysis to address any selection bias. Results Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a higher risk of stillbirths [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39, 4.96] and admission to SNCU (aOR 2.57; 95% CI 1.85, 3.58) after adjusting for pregnancy and birth-related covariates. Risk of illness among babies born to COVID-positive mothers was higher [relative risk (RR) 4.23; 95% CI 3.14, 5.69; P<0.001]. Age of attainment of developmental milestones were similar between both cohorts. Interpretation & conclusions Women who contracted COVID-19 in pregnancy were at higher risk of stillbirths, and their babies were more likely to be admitted to the SNCU as compared to their COVID-negative counterparts. There were no clinically meaningful differences between babies of both cohorts in the age at which developmental milestones were attained.

ProTCR: a protein language model-driven framework for decoding TCR-antigen recognition toward precision immunotherapies.	The ability of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize neoantigens is fundamental to the initiation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. In TCR-based immunotherapies, elucidating the recognition patterns of TCRs for peptides and accurately identifying therapeutically relevant TCR-peptide pairs remain critical challenges. Here, we present a novel dual-pathway network model, ProTCR, which integrates the protein language model ProtT5 with deep learning methods. By incorporating both global and local feature extraction mechanisms, ProTCR enables efficient representation of amino acid sequences, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability across diverse data distributions and improving its biological interpretability. ProTCR demonstrates robust performance and broad applicability across various datasets, including neoantigens, previously unseen peptides, and MHC class II-restricted epitopes, overcoming the reliance on known peptide-TCR pairs observed in previous studies. It also offers new insights for predicting diverse classes of antigenic peptides. We applied ProTCR to several clinically relevant scenarios, including immunotherapeutic target identification in acute myeloid leukemia, neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy in solid tumours, and antigen-specific T cell recognition against pathogens such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Across these complex settings, ProTCR consistently maintained high accuracy and stability, demonstrating strong cross-task adaptability and broad potential for clinical application. This work not only provides a powerful tool for elucidating immune response mechanisms but also offers a solid computational foundation for the design of neoantigen or TCR based precision immunotherapy strategies.

How to Promote School Principals' Well-Being? The Role of Job-Related Perceptions and Behaviors.	BACKGROUND: The well-being of school principals and the factors that influence it is a research area that is gaining increasing attention in the literature. School principals experience high levels of work-related stress with potential negative effects for work-ability, climate, and school effectiveness. METHODS: This study examined the work and health outcomes of Italian comprehensive and high school principals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was part of the Global Health Literacy Research Network. Two hierarchical multiple binary logistic regression models were performed with exhaustion and well-being as outcomes. RESULTS: School principals reported high levels of exhaustion and low levels of well-being. School principals from high schools were more likely to report exhaustion. Exhaustion was positively associated with work extensification and perceived helplessness and negatively associated with work-related sense of coherence. Well-being was positively associated with work-related sense of coherence and perceived self-efficacy and negatively associated with work extensification and perceived helplessness. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY, PRACTICE, AND EQUITY: These findings highlighted the importance of job-related perceptions and self-endangering behaviors for exhaustion and well-being, suggesting concrete recommendations for health-promoting interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide an overview of the well-being of Italian school principals during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of different dimensions.

Healthcare professionals' views on training, standards, and resources for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a cross-sectional survey.	AIM: To assess health care professionals' knowledge and opinions regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use, training, standards, and resource availability. METHODS: This cross-sectional study employed an online self-administered survey to evaluate health care professionals' knowledge and opinions concerning ECMO procedures. The survey consisted of multiple-choice and open-ended questions inquiring about demographics, ECMO practices, training and certification experiences, ECMO use during the COVID-19 pandemic, and obstacles to ECMO implementation. RESULTS: The study enrolled 89 health care professionals from 12 countries. The respondents were most frequently from Kazakhstan (67.4%), Turkey (5.6%), Croatia (5.6%), and Ukraine (5.6%). Notably, 61.8% of respondents supported ECMO procedures performed by certified specialists. The respondents believed that the main ECMO indications were respiratory failure (83.1%), cardiopulmonary failure (69.6%), heart and lung transplantation (64.1%), and cardiogenic shock (58.4%). Major obstacles to ECMO implementation were reported to be high costs (53.9%), inadequately qualified staff (52.8% for physicians, 41.6% for nurses), and restricted availability of ECMO devices (42.7%). CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the need for standardized training, wider availability of ECMO standards, and efforts to address resource-related barriers to ECMO access. Our results primarily reflect practices in Kazakhstan and should be interpreted in light of the study's restricted geographical coverage.

Self-perceived quality of life, health, and physical activity among older adults: the roles of marital status and residence during the COVID-19 pandemic.	AIM: To examine the associations between marital status, place of residence, self-reported health status, quality of life, and physical activity among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 962 participants aged 65 and older, surveyed between March 2020 and May 2023. Respondents were categorized according to marital status (married/living with a partner, single, divorced, widowed) and place of residence (own home vs nursing home). Standardized instruments were used: the Short Form Health Survey-36 for health status, the Personal Well-being Index for quality of life, and the Croatian short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Respondents who were married or living with a partner reported significantly higher levels of physical activity, better physical and mental health, and greater life satisfaction than single, divorced, or widowed respondents (P<0.001). Community-dwelling respondents scored significantly higher on most health and quality-of-life indicators than nursing home residents, except for perceived future security. CONCLUSION: Marital status and living arrangements significantly affected the self-perceived health, physical activity, and quality of life of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the importance of social support and residential context in promoting healthy aging.

Longitudinal anthropometric and physical performance adaptations in the Polish Deaf National basketball team during a three-year preparation for the deaflympics.	Limited research has examined long-term training adaptations in elite Deaf athletes. This three-year longitudinal observational study characterized anthropometric and physical performance changes in the Polish Deaf National Basketball Team preparing for the Deaflympics (2019-2021). Eleven male athletes (age 26.9 +/- 6.3 years) underwent annual assessments of body composition and performance, including countermovement jumps (CMJ, ACMJ), spike jump (SPJ), sprint speed (0-5 m, 0-20 m), and estimated VO(2)max. A control group of physically inactive Deaf students (n = 15; age 21.1 +/- 1.6 years) was also evaluated. Friedman ANOVA revealed stable body composition across seasons (p > 0.05; W = 0.01-0.22), except for a moderate increase in left-leg fat-free mass (p = 0.025; W = 0.33). While jump performance remained unchanged (p > 0.05; d = 0.18-0.32), sprint performance declined significantly (0-5 m: chi(2)(2) = 20.18, p < 0.001; 0-20 m: chi(2)(2) = 14.59, p = 0.001). Compared with inactive peers, players demonstrated superior physical capacity, including higher fat-free mass (d = 2.12), greater jump power (d = 3.46), and faster sprint times (d = - 1.03 to - 1.07), with a mean 2021 VO(2)max of 47.3 +/- 6.1 ml.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1). In conclusion, these elite athletes maintained morphology and power but showed declining sprint performance, likely due to COVID-19 disruptions. This study provides the first longitudinal evidence of performance trajectories in elite Deaf basketball players, underscoring the need for individualized, acceleration-focused monitoring to sustain long-term neuromuscular performance.

Telemedicine disparities among adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Telemedicine became a vital tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time marked by increased social isolation and mental health challenges among adolescents. Using data from 7,998 U.S. adolescents collected in early 2021 via the Adolescent Behavior Experience Survey, this study examined intersectional disparities in telemental health use. Stratified multivariable logistic regression models revealed significantly lower odds of telemedicine use for mental health care among marginalized groups who experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors. These included Black, Hispanic/Latino, and multi-racial Latino female adolescents; Black heterosexual adolescents; and sexual minority multi-racial non-Latino adolescents. Notably, sexual minority multi-racial non-Latino adolescents showed higher odds of telemental health care use in some cases. The findings highlight critical gaps in access and underscore the need for targeted strategies to improve equitable mental health service delivery, particularly for racially diverse sexual and gender minority youth navigating intersecting structural and identity-based inequities.

SEIRV epidemiological model for COVID 19 with Holling type II functional response.	Data-driven mathematical models are recognized as a significant tool for understanding infectious disease dynamics and have been valuable in public health research for an extended period of time. In this paper, we develop an SEIRV model that includes susceptible, exposed, infectious, and vaccinated populations to investigate the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We incorporate a Holling type-II functional response in our model, which has been widely useful in studying ecological systems. This approach enables us to conduct comprehensive analysis by integrating analytical, computational, and statistical tools, providing a deeper understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We derive a closed-form mathematical expression to compute the basic reproduction number, calculate predictive intervals for it, and analyze the sensitivity of some parameters to understand the spread of the disease.

Environmentally relevant concentrations of the antibiotic azithromycin enhance the toxicity of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa on the water flea Daphnia similis.	Artificial eutrophication has degraded water bodies worldwide, promoting harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs). In addition to nutrient loading, antibiotics are increasingly being introduced into aquatic environments, exacerbating water pollution, and the impact on biota. Among antibiotics, azithromycin (AZT) has displayed a rise in environmental occurrence following its increased global consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we assessed the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of AZT (</=3 mug l(-1)) on the interaction between the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia similis. The acute toxicity of both the cyanobacterium and antibiotic on Daphnia was determined, followed by an herbivory and a life-table assay to assess behavioral and sublethal effects under single and combined exposures. The 96-hour LC(5)(0) and EC(5)(0) for AZT were 35.2 and 29.1 mg l(-1), respectively. The risk quotient for D. similis was 0.098, indicating a low ecological risk (RQ < 0.1). Regarding M. aeruginosa, 96-hour LC(5)(0) and EC(5)(0) values were 713 and 303 mugC l(-1), respectively, with RQ values >700, indicating a high ecological risk. Environmental levels of AZT did not affect Daphnia, while the cyanobacterium inhibited zooplankter feeding and life-table responses. However, combined exposure to AZT and toxic M. aeruginosa resulted in a greater decrease in survival and overall population fitness, besides an increased cyanobacterial ingestion. These findings suggest that environmental concentrations of AZT may intensify the impacts of toxic cyanobacteria on zooplankton. This highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying the enhanced toxicity of cyanobacteria promoted by antibiotics at environmental levels.

Preferential boosting of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage-specific immune responses by monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination.	OBJECTIVES: Ongoing escape from pre-existing antibodies by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates yearly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine updates. Monovalent variant-specific booster vaccines for at-risk populations aim to re-direct antibody responses towards antigenically distinct variants. However, multiple past exposures to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein through vaccination and infection could hinder the de novo induction of variant-specific immune responses. METHODS: Here, we profiled SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody, T- and B-cell immune responses in healthcare workers up to 6 months after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. RESULTS: Neutralizing antibodies targeting Omicron subvariants circulating at the time of vaccination were preferentially boosted by vaccination but remained lower than those neutralizing the ancestral strain. Similar responses were observed for antibodies that mediate functionality through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, although these responses were more promiscuous. Broadly S-reactive B-cells were recalled by vaccination, with limited de novo induction of XBB.1.5-specific B-cell clones. B-cells targeting the receptor binding domain of circulating Omicron subvariants were favored, and T-cell responses cross-reacted with all SARS-CoV-2 variants that were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, this comprehensive immune profiling demonstrates that despite evidence of imprinted antibody responses targeting ancestral S, monovalent booster vaccination skews the immune response to Omicron lineage recognition.

Past Behavior Predicts Future Protection: Uncovering Key Drivers of Influenza Vaccine Acceptance in Italy in the Post-Pandemic Era.	OBJECTIVES: Influenza is a seasonal viral respiratory disease causing significant global mortality but preventable through vaccination. Despite WHO recommendations, vaccination rates in Italy remain low due to mistrust, misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy. This study investigates determinants of influenza vaccine uptake in the post-COVID-19 era to identify barriers and guide targeted interventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a representative sample of 8,067 Italian adults between December 2024 and January 2025 through an anonymous online questionnaire. The survey explored sociodemographic characteristics, infectious disease behaviors, COVID-19 pandemic experiences, and vaccination attitudes. RESULTS: Overall, 33.7% of respondents received the influenza vaccine, while 61.8% reported no vaccination intention. Multinomial logistic regression identified three key domains of predictors. Sociodemographic determinants associated with uptake included age 65-75 years (OR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.11-3.19), inactive employment status (OR=1.73; 95% CI: 1.12-2.67), and comorbidities (OR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.00-1.50). Past vaccination history emerged as the strongest driver of uptake (OR=8.19; 95% CI: 3.98-16.84). Finally, behavioral factors, specifically the perception of mask usefulness, were significantly associated with vaccination intention among the unvaccinated (OR=1.39; 95% CI: 1.11-1.75). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination adherence in Italy is influenced by sociodemographic factors and preventive health practices, but most strongly by past vaccination behavior that should, thus, strength long-term engagement with vaccination programs.

Factors impacting the recent doubling of French hyperglycaemia prevalence in pregnancy.	AIM: . - To assessed hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) prevalence trends over the past decade, accounting for risk factors and screening practices (France introduced early risk-based HIP screening in 2010). METHODS: . - We analysed national delivery data from the French National Health Data System (SNDS) (2012-2022), excluding women with pre-existing diabetes (n=8,172,911). Poisson regressions with generalized estimating equations estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for HIP risk factors. Counterfactual scenarios quantified contributions of maternal age, early screening, and pre-pregnancy overweight to HIP increase. RESULTS: . - HIP prevalence increased from 7.5% in 2012 to 15.7% in 2022, with early HIP tripling. Prevalence rose in 2020-2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. After adjustment for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, season of pregnancy onset, place of delivery, regional prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight, and early screening, the aPR were 1.30 [1.11-1.51] in 2021 and 1.15 [0.97-1.36] in 2022 vs. 2012 (unadjusted: 2.24 [2.22-2.26] and 2.08 [2.06-2.10]), suggesting that these factors account for a large proportion of the observed increase. While the observed increase in HIP prevalence was 8.2 percentage points from 2012 to 2022, counterfactual scenarios estimated increases of 6.5 [5.9-7.3] for constant maternal age, 6.2 [5.1-7.7] for constant early screening (13.7%), and 4.3 [2.4-5.9] for constant regional pre-pregnancy overweight (11.8%) at 2012 levels. CONCLUSION: . - Rising maternal age, increased early HIP screening, and higher regional pre-pregnancy overweight prevalence mostly contributed to HIP prevalence increase. Public health strategies should prioritize modifiable risk factors-particularly pre-pregnancy overweight-and evaluate the effectiveness of early screening practices.

Description of Three Dysfunctional Breathing Patterns in post-COVID dyspnea.	INTRODUCTION: Dysfunctional breathing (DB) can be defined as a change in breathing pattern associated with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, after ruling out underlying respiratory or cardiac disease. Recent evidence suggests that DB contributes to dyspnea in post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), as demonstrated by ventilation analysis during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Nevertheless, the lack of a standardized classification for the different subtypes of DB poses challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective management. We hypothesized that analyzing the evolution of breathing parameters during CPET may help classify DB into three patterns. METHODS: We analyzed 79 CPETs performed between July 2020 and May 2022 on patients with persistent respiratory symptoms at least three months after COVID-19 infection. We classified patients into three different categories based on abnormal breathing patterns: hyperventilation (HYPV), erratic breathing (ERBR), and flattening (FLAT). RESULTS: Age, BMI, gender and peak O2 uptake (V̇O2) were similar between patterns. Compared to normal pattern (N), we found higher V̇E - V̇CO2 slope in HYPV and FLAT, and a lower VT/ V̇E slope in FLAT and ERBR. The FLAT pattern was also characterized by a higher breathing frequency at peak exercise compared to the other patterns. ERBR and FLAT were associated with higher symptom scores (Nijmegen Questionnaire and Dyspnea-12) compared to N. CONCLUSION: Analyzing the evolution of ventilatory parameters during incremental exercise enables the classification of dysfunctional breathing into three distinct breathing patterns: hyperventilation, erratic breathing, and flattening.

7-year trend of timely hepatitis B birth dose vaccination coverage in The Gambia: a retrospective, population-based analysis.	BACKGROUND: According to WHO and UNICEF, Africa has the lowest coverage (18%) of timely (within the first 24 h) hepatitis B birth dose (HepB-BD) vaccination worldwide. To eliminate hepatitis B by 2030, 90% vaccination coverage is required. Experiences from The Gambia, the first African country to adopt HepB-BD vaccination in 1990, could guide HepB-BD implementation and scale-up in Africa. We aimed to assess the trend of, and barriers to, timely HepB-BD vaccination coverage over a 7-year period in The Gambia. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, 2015-21 data were extracted from population-based Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems in three rural areas (Basse, Bansang, and Farafenni) in The Gambia. Fluctuation tests and Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods assessed the rate of timely (within days 0-1 of birth) and delayed HepB-BD vaccination coverage, change points (abrupt variation between two stable periods) in the average coverage of timely HepB-BD vaccination, and the factors associated with delayed HepB-BD vaccination during the first 7 years following the WHO recommendations on hepatitis B elimination. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2021, 4560 of 71 088 livebirths (6.4%, 95% CI 6.2-6.6) received a timely HepB-BD. Timely HepB-BD vaccination coverage increased from 1.7% (95% CI 1.3-2.0) in the first half of 2015 (ie, January to June) to 22.4% (21.3-23.6) in the second half of 2021 (ie, July to December; p<0.0001). Delayed HepB-BD administration was associated with being born on Friday (odds ratio [OR] 3.51 [95% CI 3.03-4.08]; p<0.0001) or Saturday (5.93 [4.96-7.13]; p<0.0001) compared with Tuesday; being born in Basse (2.03 [95% CI 1.83-2.25]; p<0.0001) or Farafenni (1.84 [1.63-2.08]; p<0.0001); and being born during the rainy season (1.16 [1.08-1.25]; p<0.0001). Average timely HepB-BD vaccination coverage significantly decreased from 10.1% (95% CI 9.5-10.6) pre-COVID-19 pandemic to 5.4% (4.5-6.3) during the first COVID-19 wave (p<0.0001). After adjusting for all other factors, being born during the first COVID-19 wave was associated with delayed HepB-BD vaccination (OR 1.41 [1.22-1.64]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: 30 years after the adoption of HepB-BD in The Gambia, the rate of vaccination coverage remains low and was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the challenges for its implementation.

Medical oxygen and respiratory support requirements for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in 23 low-income and middle-income countries: a prospective, observational cohort study.	BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a global shortage of, and inequity of access to, medical oxygen. Understanding patient outcomes and the capacities of health facilities to provide respiratory support including oxygen is key to matching need and demand. We report results from a global study including 23 low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: For this prospective, observational cohort study, consecutive patients aged 12 years or older with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively recruited within 24 h of hospital admission. Hospitals from 23 low-income and middle-income countries were included, representing all WHO regions. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, and daily follow-ups were recorded for in-hospital outcomes and respiratory support types. At the facility level, we assessed sources of oxygen and electricity, infrastructural and staffing capacity for critical care provision, and the capabilities of the facility for advanced respiratory support. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04918875). FINDINGS: Between Jan 24 and Nov 22, 2022, 56 sites took part. Of 53 726 patients screened, 3070 were enrolled. 1814 (61.6%) of 2947 patients had two or more underlying medical conditions and initially received oxygen through nasal cannula or non-rebreather face masks with reservoir. Invasive mechanical ventilation was most frequently used in patients recruited in the Americas (75 [26.4%] of 284 patients) and in the Eastern Mediterranean (90 [18.0%] of 499 patients). The overall mortality was 649 (23.4%) of 2779 patients, varying by region from 53 (10.5%) of 506 patients in South-East Asia to 286 (37.6%) of 760 patients in Africa. Mortality was associated with the maximum level of respiratory support received: from 17 (8.6%) of 198 patients who received no oxygen, 99 (38.4%) of 258 patients for non-rebreather reservoir bags, and 205 (62.9%) of 326 for invasive ventilation. INTERPRETATION: The availability and use of oxygen support options in low-income and middle-income countries are highly variable but appear significantly less in the African region. Mortality might be associated with a lack of access to oxygen, which varied across WHO regions but was highest in Africa. Despite many lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, inequity in access to medical oxygen remains a challenge that WHO and partners must address in the post-pandemic era to avoid preventable deaths.

Differences in influenza vaccine effectiveness by sex among adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness-IVY network, January 24, 2022-September 1, 2024.	This analysis assessed differences in influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and severe in-hospital outcomes between U.S. male and female adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza in a multi-center network during 2022-2024. Compared with men, women hospitalized with influenza were less likely to smoke (21.5 % vs 25.3 %, P = 0.02), to have COPD (21.9 % vs 22.7 %, P < 0.001), and to be admitted to an intensive care unit once hospitalized (17.3 % vs 20.7 %, P = 0.04). Influenza VE (95 % confidence interval [CI]) was significantly higher in women aged >/=50 years compared with men aged >/=50 years (48.5 % [39.2 %-56.4 %] vs 26.2 % [13.0 %-37.5 %]). VE was slightly lower in women aged 18-49 years compared with women >/=50 years (46.2 % [95 % CI: 24.2 %-61.8 % vs 61.3 % [41.0 %-74.6 %]) but significantly lower in men aged >/=50 years compared with men aged 18-49 years (61.3 % [41.0 %-74.6 %] vs 26.2 % [13.0 %-37.5 %]). Disaggregation of sex should be considered in future influenza VE studies.

Real-world COVID-19 immunity in multiple sclerosis (CoVaR-MS): A longitudinal follow up study.	COVID-19 vaccination in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has continued clinical relevance. Complex dosing and variability in immunosuppression/ immunomodulation from disease modifying treatments (DMTs) necessitate real-world studies of COVID-19 immunity. We aimed to evaluate if PwMS develop adequate and persistent serological and cellular COVID-19 immunity after vaccination. We conducted a real-world longitudinal study (n = 235) including PwMS (n = 205; Alemtuzumab, Dimethyl fumarate, Fingolimod, Interferon, Natalizumab, Ocrelizumab, no-DMT) and Healthy volunteers (HV) (n = 30). Serological and cellular immunity was tested at </=18 and </=24-month after completed COVID-19 vaccine-course. 97 % of both HV and PwMS were immune at </=18-month, and 96.9 % PwMS and 100 % HV at </=24-month, (OR 0.33, 95 % CI (0.09, 0.93), p = 0.05)). Both groups showed similar cellular immunity at both timepoints. Vaccine Adverse effects incidence was similar too. PwMS on Ocrelizumab were significantly less likely to have low serological immunity (p < 0.001 at both timepoints). They were more likely to have intact T cell responses than HV (OR 5.4, 95 % CI 1.28-22.60). Despite this, they had higher infections per person year. PwMS on Fingolimod also had low serological immunity (Odd's ratio 0.33; CI 0.11-0.97) which stayed low despite boosters and only 6 % showed intact cellular immunity, probably due to lymphopenia. Other DMT-treated PwMS (Natalizumab, Dimethyl Fumarate, Interferon, and no no-DMT) showed comparable COVID-19 serological and cellular immunity as HV. We report COVID-19 immunity clearly over time and across various DMT-groups. Ocrelizumab lowered serological but maintained cellular immunity; whilst Fingolimod lowered both. Data support boosters in PwMS, more so on Ocrelizumab and Fingolimod.

Effect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate approval on the management of acute hyperkalemia in Japan: Interrupted time series analysis.	INTRODUCTION: The impact of the new potassium binder sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) on the real-world management of acute hyperkalemia remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in treatment strategies and clinical outcomes for acute hyperkalemia following the approval of SZC in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the RWD database, a nationwide electronic medical record and claims database in Japan, including adult patients who were hospitalized with hyperkalemia (serum potassium >/=5.5 mmol/L) between April 2015 and December 2024. Using an interrupted time series analysis, we evaluated changes in outcomes following SZC approval in April 2020. The post-approval period was stratified to distinguish the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary outcome was the monthly proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and maintenance hemodialysis initiation. RESULTS: Overall, 38,540 hospitalizations were included. While no significant immediate change in RRT use occurred upon SZC approval, a significant decreasing trend was subsequently observed (slope change, -0.7% per month; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.2 to -0.1%). This downward trend in RRT use was highly pronounced after the COVID-19 pandemic ended. A significant decreasing trend in ICU admissions was observed in the post-pandemic period (slope change, -4.2% per month; 95% CI, -6.6 to -1.7%). Trends of in-hospital mortality and maintenance hemodialysis initiation did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS: Following SZC approval, a decreasing trend in the use of RRT for acute hyperkalemia was observed, along with a post-pandemic decrease in ICU admissions. These trends were not accompanied by an observable increase in in-hospital mortality or initiation of maintenance hemodialysis.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of 2024-2025 Seasonal mRNA-1273 Vaccination Against COVID-19-Related Hospitalizations and Medically Attended COVID-19 Among Adults Aged >/= 18 years in the United States: An Observational Matched Cohort Study.	INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the effectiveness of Moderna's updated mRNA-1273 vaccine targeting the KP.2 variant, compared to people who did not receive any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and medically-attended COVID-19 among adults aged >/= 18 years in the United States during the 2024-2025 season. METHODS: Data were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 23 April 2025 and followed through 30 April 2025. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall, 596,248 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high-risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.8%, 65.8%] against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically-attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 55 (interquartile range 32-77) days in an interim analysis. The VE was sustained throughout the entire study period and shown to be 45.2% (37.7%, 51.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and 33.1% (30.6-35.4%) against medically-attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 127 (interquartile range 84-173) days. CONCLUSION: The mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically-attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date. The VE was sustained with longer median follow up time. These findings support ongoing vaccination efforts to mitigate the public health impact of COVID-19.

Social and Healthcare Disruptions Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations with Psychosocial Well-Being Among Cancer Survivors With and Without HIV: Findings from the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study.	People with HIV (PWH) with a history of cancer are more likely to experience poor psychosocial well-being compared to those without HIV. This study aims to assess the associations between social and healthcare disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic with psychosocial well-being among cancer survivors with and without HIV. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and September 2020 among participants of the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study with a history of cancer. The primary exposures were social disruptions (loss of job, child care, financial support, housing, and health insurance) and healthcare disruptions (unable to attend a healthcare appointment, obtain medications, and afford medical care). Psychosocial outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, stress, loneliness, social support, social support satisfaction, and resilient coping. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using multivariable Poisson regression. Cancer survivors (N = 452) included 63.7% PWH and 51.5% men. Overall, PWH were more likely to experience social disruptions compared to those without HIV (49.6% vs. 36.6%; p = 0.008). Among cancer survivors with HIV, two or more social disruptions were associated with high depressive symptoms (aPR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.56, 3.08), anxiety symptoms (aPR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.25, 4.48), stress (aPR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.25, 8.79), and loneliness (aPR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.25, 3.74), and one or more healthcare disruptions were associated with high depressive symptoms (aPR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.22, 1.94), stress (aPR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.53, 5.58), loneliness (aPR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.23, 2.57), and low social support (aPR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.82). Disruptions were associated with poorer mental health among PWH but not among people without HIV.

Quantitative Tissue Proteomics Reveals Protein Signatures Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Variant Infection in Hamsters.	Since its emergence in 2019, circulating SARS-CoV-2 has been dominated by waves of genetically distinct variants with varying pathogenicity. Understanding the multidimensional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their associations with pathogenesis is critical for developing therapies to prevent severe illness and death. Here, we applied quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome analyses to compare host responses to infections with an ancestral variant (WA-1/2020), a Delta variant (B.1.617.2), and an Omicron variant (BA.1) of SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian golden hamster tissues at 5 days postinfection, when peak inflammatory responses were observed. As has been observed by others, animals infected with the Delta variant lost more weight than those infected with other variants, and this effect was associated with decreased cilia proteins in the trachea tissue and increased signatures of fibrosis in lung tissue. Phosphoproteome analysis revealed a downregulation of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling across all variants, suggesting a suppressed proliferative response in tissues following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data provide critical in vivo confirmation of observations from in vitro studies and provide a quantitative tissue- and SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific resource of proteome and phosphoproteome responses.

Patients Suffering From Post-COVID-19 Syndrome Feature Enhanced Antibody Reactivity Towards Specific Linear Epitopes Within EBV EBNA1.	Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS; also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, PASC and Long COVID) manifests with various clinical symptoms of unclear aetiology that persist or develop months after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Potential triggers for PCS include reactivation of latent viruses and autoimmune reactions. In our retrospective cross-sectional and explorative study we compared 48 PCS patients with 48 individuals that recovered fully from COVID-19 (convalescents, CC). We focused on characterising humoral immunity by recording IgG antibody reactivity patterns against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 antigen using peptide microarray and ELISA methodology as well as determining the presence of autoantibodies. The overall binding landscape of IgG antibodies for the EBV EBNA1 protein was similar for the patients with sequelae versus the convalescents. However, the PCS patients displayed stronger reactivity for epitopes contained within the glycine-alanine repeat region of EBNA1, in particular residues 90-325, and within the central part, amino acids 393-420. Intriguingly, in the latter case, the EBNA1 peptide (residues 405-419) that discriminated the PCS and CC cohorts was localised in a different segment C-terminal from the sequence proposed to be mechanistically associated with multiple sclerosis. The screening for autoantibodies against nuclear/cytoplasmic antigens in HEp-2 cells and against CRYAB, cardiolipin, beta-2-glycoprotein I, IFN-alpha2, IFN-omega, and IL-15 antigens did neither reveal higher prevalence nor increased reactivity in the PCS patients compared to the convalescents. In conclusion, elevated antibody levels against linear peptides derived from residues 90-325 and 405-419 of EBV EBNA1 were the most distinctive characteristics in our cohort of post-COVID-19 syndrome patients.

Transforming challenges into growth: a dialogical autoethnography of a japanese woman leader in higher education during COVID-19.	We explored how dialogical autoethnography can illuminate the transformative potential of leadership struggles during COVID-19. Focusing on experiences of the first author-a Japanese woman leader serving as a higher-education institution dean from 2020-2023-we examined how initially negative challenges gradually evolved into growth opportunities. COVID-19 forced institutions to undergo rapid digital transformation in a context where Japan lagged behind other countries, requiring training in new technologies, coping with canceled in-person orientation programs, and addressing rising student isolation and mental health concerns. Students faced suspended study-abroad opportunities and prolonged uncertainty until the emergence of vaccine. The first author shared her experiences through dialogues with the second author, who acted as a dialogical collaborator. We combined emic (insider) and etic (outsider) perspectives through iterative cycles of conversation, transcription, and reflective memo writing, enabling both researchers to trace how overwhelming emotions-e.g., anxiety, frustration, and shame-were gradually reinterpreted as sources of resilience, pride, and professional growth. Dialogical autoethnography uncovers hidden learning in crisis leadership and shows how collaborative reflection helped the first author understand her transformation of vulnerability into strength. We contribute to leadership and higher-education research by offering insights into women's crisis leadership and demonstrating dialogical autoethnography's methodological value.

Selection and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Binding Clickmers.	Expanding the chemical repertoire of canonical nucleotides is key to unlocking the full functional potential of aptamers for diagnostic use. Herein, click-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is employed to generate chemically modified DNA aptamers, termed clickmers, that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV2-S) glycoprotein. Two independent split-combine selection strategies yield distinct clickmer families functionalized with benzofuran or indole moieties. Lead candidates (BF1 and N2) demonstrate nanomolar affinity for wild-type CoV2-S and maintain binding to multiple variants, including Alpha, Delta, and Mu, as validated by flow cytometry, surface plasmon resonance, and microscale thermophoresis. Structure-function analysis reveals essential click-in positions for both full-length clickmers and a truncated N2 variant, as short as 31 nucleotides, which displays increased binding to the Omicron variant. These results highlight the versatility of the click-SELEX platform and exemplify its successful application to a clinically relevant target, advancing previous developments in the field.

Vaccination in the Age of Memes: An Exploration of Digital Health Communication.	"This study explores how internet memes serve as digital communication tools in public health discourse, influencing public perceptions by spreading both accurate and misleading health information. Utilizing a dual qualitative approach, Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) and Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA), this study examined 99 vaccine-related memes shared online during the 2019 and 2025 measles outbreaks and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. QCA analyzed rhetorical tones (pathos, ethos, and logos) and vaccine stances (pro, anti, and neutral), while RTA identified key themes. Memes were sampled from Google Images using broad vaccine-related search terms (e.g., ""vaccine meme,"" ""vaccination meme""), allowing inclusion of memes related to a wide range of vaccine-preventable diseases rather than limiting the dataset to any single condition. While memes predominantly targeted emotional appeals (pathos), emergent themes include increased use of logical appeals (logos), political polarization, and anti-vaccine sentiments. Nurses and other public health communicators must counter misinformation and foster evidence-based dialogue to shape digital health literacy. Rhetorical patterns (e.g., humor, emotional resonance, and appeals to credibility) are communication strategies that transcend national boundaries. These findings, therefore, provide a foundation for understanding how similar dynamics might appear in other linguistic and cultural settings, while highlighting the need for ongoing research."

Persistent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in an Immunocompromised Host Treated Successfully With the Japanese Herbal Medicine, Mao-to: A Case Report.	"BACKGROUND Persistent COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, such as those with B-cell depletion or hematologic malignancies, is an important clinical challenge. Clinically, cases that do not respond to guideline-based antivirals, such as molnupiravir, remdesivir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, are occasionally encountered, but effective therapeutic alternatives remain scarce. We report a case of persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection unresponsive to guideline-based antivirals, for which the traditional Japanese herbal medicine Mao-to (Ma-huang-tang) led to clinical improvement. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man, who underwent treatment for follicular lymphoma with anti-cluster of differentiation-20 antibody and achieved remission, developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite 1 course of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir each and multiple courses of remdesivir and corticosteroids each, SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted for over 2 months. Following these treatments, the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold (Ct) value was 27.6, indicating active COVID-19. Given the lack of further treatment options and clinical stability, Mao-to (Ma-huang-tang), a Japanese herbal medicine (""Kampo""), was then administered as a commercially available extract granule (2.5 g, 3 times daily) for 14 days. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Ct value improved to 41, suggesting a marked reduction in viral load, with improved clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Mao-to may offer a cost-effective adjunctive option for persistent COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients who fail to respond to conventional therapies. In addition, 14 days of Mao-to treatment cost approximately 1200 JPY (USD $8), significantly less than extended courses of standard antivirals. This case suggests the potential utility of traditional herbal medicine in managing persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections when conventional therapies fail."

Psychological distress in Spanish-speaking countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Psychological distress (PD) has increased significantly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In Spanish-speaking countries, with their cultural, social, and economic diversity, this phenomenon has become particularly relevant and has been aggravated by factors such as socioeconomic inequalities and unequal access to mental health services. The aim of this systematic review was to consolidate the available knowledge on PD in Spanish-speaking population groups by assessing both the prevalence of symptoms and the associated factors in different demographic groups and geographic contexts, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement was conducted in the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus electronic databases in January 2025. The search included studies published from the beginning of the pandemic until May 2023. The Joanna Briggs Institute's critical assessment tool was used to evaluate the chosen studies' methodological quality. RESULTS: A total of 53 studies were included in the review, which involved research conducted in Spain, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, and Colombia. The results revealed a high prevalence of PD in these countries, especially among healthcare workers, women, and young people. The assessment methods used included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ, GHQ-12, and GHQ-28 versions), the Kessler scale (K-6 and K-10 versions), and the 90-symptom checklist questionnaire (SCL-90-R), that allowed obtaining various dimensions of PD. The studies also highlighted the importance of the sense of coherence and work engagement as protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 pandemic, PD was analyzed to be severe in Spanish-speaking countries, pointing to the need for specific and culturally adapted interventions to address this public mental health crisis. This is why public health policies must focus on the prevention and treatment of PD, with special attention to the most vulnerable groups.

Epidemiological trends of depression and anxiety at global, regional, and national level: A population-based observational study from 1990 to 2021 based on Global Burden of Disease 2021.	Mental disorders are significant contributors to the global disease burden, of which depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders diseases. We aimed to achieve a more accurate representation of the health burden of depression and anxiety using the standardized Global Burden of Disease methodologies. To measure temporal patterns and evaluate trends in age-standardized rates of anxiety and depression, age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) are calculated from 1990 to 2021. Temporal trends from 1990 to 2021 were strictly examined by using Joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in trends over time. This methodological approach enabled the calculation of the annual percentage change, the average annual percentage change, and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analyses were broken down by gender, 20 age groups, 21 Global Burden of Disease regions, 204 countries/territories, and 5 sociodemographic index (SDI) quintiles. Globally, from 1990 to 2021, ASPR, ASIR, and ASDR for anxiety in 2021 have increased by 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.74), 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.81), and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55-0.74), respectively. For depression, corresponding increases were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.3-0.45), 0.49 (95% CI: 0.4-0.63), and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35-0.54), respectively. Gender comparisons and geographical and demographic distribution showed notable differences in the 2 diseases burden. The specific manifestation is that females consistently showed higher burden than males for both disorders. High-SDI regions had the highest age-standardized rates for anxiety, whereas for depression, the highest rates were observed in low-SDI regions. From 1990 to 2021, ASPR, ASIR, and ASDR for anxiety and depression exhibited significant annual increases, particularly pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiological trends during the period emphasize significant disparities in the burden of anxiety and depressive disorders across geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic dimensions. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted mental health interventions, particularly in high-burden regions like Tropical Latin America and among females and younger populations, to address the rising burden of anxiety and depression.

Oral Health-Related Quality of Life and Self-Reported Oral Health Status Are Associated with Change in Self-Reported Depression Status: A Cohort Study.	Background/Objectives: Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) may influence mental health outcomes, yet longitudinal evidence on its association with depression remains limited. This study aimed to examine whether oral health status and OHRQoL are associated with a change in self-reported depression status among adults in Japan. Methods: We analyzed data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS), conducted in 2022 and 2023. A total of 15,068 participants aged >/=20 years without depression at baseline were included. Depression status was identified by self-reported measures between the two survey waves. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for change in self-reported depression status in relation to OHRQoL and oral health status, adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Results: During follow-up, 218 participants (1.45%) reported a change in self-reported depression status. Poorer OHRQoL was significantly associated with a change in self-reported depression status (OR: 1.018; 95% CI: 1.001-1.036; p = 0.039). Additional risk factors included younger age (OR: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.964-0.985), participation in hobbies and cultural activities (OR: 2.224; 95% CI: 1.498-3.302), habitual use of sleeping pills or anxiolytics (current use OR: 3.512; 95% CI: 2.267-5.442), increased loneliness (OR: 1.217; 95% CI: 1.140-1.299), lower life satisfaction (OR: 0.900; 95% CI: 0.836-0.969), and poor self-rated health (OR: 2.921; 95% CI: 1.810-4.715). Conclusions: Impaired OHRQoL was associated with a change in self-reported depression status, potentially through psychosocial mechanisms. These findings suggest that oral health and OHRQoL may be relevant factors to consider in integrated oral and mental health approaches in clinical practice.

Cross-Sectional Study on Electrocardiographic Disorders in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis in Real-World Conditions.	Background/Objectives: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been associated with various comorbidities, including cardiovascular morbidity. Recent studies suggest that certain arrhythmias may be more frequent in AS patients than in the general population. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of electric heart disorders (EHD) in patients with AS in real-world conditions and compare them with those reported in the general population. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study aiming to determine the prevalence of EHD in AS in pre-COVID-19 period. EHD were analyzed in a resting ECG and 24 h Holter monitoring. Additionally, the association between clinical and demographic variables was analyzed. Results: Among 121 patients with AS (62% men; mean +/- SD age 54.6 +/- 15.6 years; median [IQR] disease duration 14 (8-20) years), 18.2% presented any EHD, including 9.1% with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) (5% atrial fibrillation [AF]) and 7.4% with atrioventricular block (AVB). Clinically relevant disorders (>/=2nd-degree AVB or SVT) were observed in 9.9% of patients. In adjusted analyses, SVT was independently associated with older age and higher BMI, while any conduction delay and clinically relevant EHD were associated with age, hypertension, and disease-modifying antirheumatic-drug treatment duration. Comparisons with previous population-based studies showed similar data, with a non-significant trend toward higher AF prevalence in AS patients. Conclusions: There appears to be a trend toward a higher prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with AS in real-world conditions, which could have clinical and therapeutic implications. An association between EHD and pro-inflammatory conditions such as age and BMI was observed, supporting the hypothesis that underlying inflammation might contribute to increased arrhythmogenicity.

Association Between Obesity and Post-COVID-19 Condition in Military Conscripts.	Objectives: Obesity has been suggested as a possible risk factor for the post-COVID-19 condition, but most studies rely only on body mass index (BMI), which does not reflect body fat distribution. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a simple anthropometric indicator of central obesity and a practical proxy for body fat distribution, yet it has not been studied in relation to the post-COVID-19 condition. This study aimed to examine whether obesity, measured by BMI and WHtR, is associated with the post-COVID-19 condition. Methods: A total of 500 male military conscripts (aged 18 years) underwent anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference). Participants with prior COVID-19 were asked whether they had persistent or new symptoms after infection. BMI categories followed WHO definitions, and WHtR >/= 0.50 was used to define central obesity. Results: Of the 376 participants who had previously experienced COVID-19, 82 (21%) experienced the post-COVID-19 condition. Obesity (BMI >/= 30) was more common among those with the post-COVID-19 condition than those without (15% vs. 5%). BMI-defined obesity was associated with higher odds of the post-COVID-19 condition (OR 2.80, 95%CI 1.25-6.24). Central obesity was also more frequent in the post-COVID-19 condition (26% vs. 14%) and was linked to increased odds as well (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.97). Conclusions: Both BMI-defined obesity and central obesity were associated with the post-COVID-19 condition. While WHtR does not directly quantify body fat distribution, it represents a simple and feasible anthropometric indicator. Therefore, it may be an additional useful tool for identifying individuals at higher risk of prolonged symptoms after COVID-19 infection.

Surgical Timing and Safety of Breast Cancer Operations After COVID-19: A Prospective-Only Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic raised uncertainties regarding the safe timing of breast cancer surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and robust prospective evidence has remained limited. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (2020-2024) investigating postoperative outcomes in breast cancer patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection </=90 days before surgery versus contemporaneous non-infected controls treated at the same institutions and in the same period. PROSPERO CRD420251174613. Random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird with Hartung-Knapp adjustment) were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Results: Twelve prospective cohort studies, including 7812 patients, compared breast cancer surgery after recent confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over 90 days with contemporaneous non-infected controls treated at the same centres. Overall, recent infection was associated with higher 30-day postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo >/= II) compared to. non-infected patients (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.44-2.81) and increased venous thromboembolism (3.6%vs. 1.2%; OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.29-7.55). Early surgery 14 days after infection carried the highest risk of complications (OR 4.38, 95 CI 2.31-8.30), whereas operations performed >/=6 weeks yielded outcomes comparable to non-infected controls (OR 1.03, 95 CI 0.81-1.31); 30-day mortality remained very low (0.3). Conclusions: Breast cancer surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with excess perioperative risk only when performed within the first two weeks. Delaying surgery to approximately six weeks minimises complications and VTE without compromising short-term safety.

Impact of a Teledermatology-Based Referral Model on Melanoma Diagnostic Pathways and Clinicopathologic Features: A Retrospective Comparative Study Between Face-to-Face Consultation (2019) and Teledermatology (2022) in a Tertiary Hospital.	Background/Objectives: Teledermatology has transformed access to dermatologic care, yet its association with melanoma prognostic parameters and diagnostic pathways in tertiary settings remains incompletely characterized. To compare the clinicopathologic profile of melanomas diagnosed under face-to-face consultation (2019) versus teledermatology-based referral (teleconsultation) (2022). Methods: A retrospective observational study comparing two patient cohorts: those diagnosed with melanoma via in-person consultation in 2019, and those diagnosed through teleconsultation in 2022. These years were selected to reflect the structural shift in care delivery models before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, during which teledermatology was formally implemented. Sociodemographic, clinical, and histopathological variables were collected. A multivariable logistic regression model assessed variables associated with being diagnosed in the 2022 teledermatology cohort versus the 2019 face-to-face cohort. Statistical analyses were performed using R (v. 4.4.3). Results: A total of 151 patients were included (89 in-person in 2019, 62 via teleconsultation in 2022). Multivariable analysis identified three variables independently associated with being diagnosed via teleconsultation. Increasing Breslow thickness was inversely associated with teleconsultation diagnosis (OR 0.60 per 1 mm increase; 95% CI 0.40-0.91; p= 0.017). Similarly, the presence of histologic regression (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.09-0.90; p = 0.032) and immunosuppression (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.008-0.86; p = 0.037) were inversely associated with teleconsultation diagnosis. No significant associations were found for sex, age, tumor location, ulceration, mitosis, or clinical stage. Conclusions: In this retrospective single-center comparison of two care models, melanomas diagnosed through teleconsultation in 2022 were associated with a more favorable clinicopathologic profile at diagnosis than those diagnosed via face-to-face consultation in 2019. These findings support the role of teledermatology-based referral pathways in facilitating timely melanoma assessment, although causal inference is limited by the observational design.

Antibiotic Prescribing in Patients Presenting with COVID-19: A Closed-Loop Audit with a Targeted Educational Intervention in a South Australian Hospital.	Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance is an escalating public health threat. Despite the low prevalence of community-acquired bacterial coinfection (CABC) in patients presenting with COVID-19, antibiotics are frequently prescribed. We evaluated antibiotic prescribing for suspected CABC in adults admitted with COVID-19 to a metropolitan referral hospital in South Australia and the impact of a targeted, locally developed educational intervention. Methods: We conducted a closed-loop retrospective audit of consecutive adult COVID-19 non-intensive care unit admissions to the General Medicine Unit over a six-month period (5 February-6 August 2024), totalling 126 episodes after exclusions. Antibiotic prescribing rates were compared before and after implementation of targeted education to admitting clinicians. This was delivered via guideline-focused presentations at unit meetings, emails and posters in key clinical areas detailing the consensus recommendation, and brief electronic reminder messages. Prescribing appropriateness was inferred from adherence to the consensus recommendation, which included predefined criteria relating to total leukocyte count, neutrophilia, and radiological findings. Statistical comparisons were performed using appropriate statistical tests for categorical and continuous variables. Results: Following the intervention, antibiotic prescribing decreased from 26% to 22% of admissions (p = 0.57), and prescribing among patients who did not meet the specified criteria fell from 16% to 6% (p = 0.30). The proportion of prescriptions meeting the consensus criteria increased from 62% to 80% (p = 0.43). Conclusions: Baseline antibiotic use was substantially lower than commonly published rates but still exceeded expected CABC prevalence. Targeted education and simple, locally adaptable guidance may support improved antimicrobial stewardship in COVID-19 admissions.

Objectives: This study seeks to analyze physical function and frailty transitions in older adults at 1, 12, and 18 months after hospital discharge for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Furthermore, we examined risk factors associated with patterns of changes. Methods: This is an observational, longitudinal, unicentric study. Participants aged >/=80 years who were admitted to a Spanish tertiary hospital and survived COVID-19 were included. Functional status was evaluated at baseline and after 1, 12, and 18 months of discharge using the Barthel Index (BI) and Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and frailty was assessed using the FRAIL scale. Clinical, sociodemographic, and functional parameters were evaluated as covariates. Results: Two hundred and thirty-three individuals (mean age 86.2 +/- 4.0 years, 48.9% men) were included. Patterns of changes were classified into three categories as follows: no changes (i.e., same score at baseline and follow-up), improvement (i.e., better results at follow-up), and worsening (i.e., detriments at follow-up). Worse frailty status at baseline [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.39] and longer length of stay (RRR = 1.03) were associated with higher risk of frailty impairment (worsening pattern). Older age (RRR = 1.11), longer length of stay (RRR = 1.03), and worse baseline physical function (RRR = 1.01) and FRAIL scores (RRR = 1.37) were associated with impairments in physical status at 18 months. Conclusions: Three distinct patterns of changes in functionality and frailty were observed among older adults discharged after COVID-19. Age, length of stay, and worse frailty and functional status at baseline emerged as significant risk factors for worsening in the examined conditions.

Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 and Myasthenic-like Symptom Complications in Two Relatives: A Coincidence or Spike Toxicity with Thymic Response in Predisposed Individuals? Two Clinical Cases with a Comprehensive Literature Review.	"Pneumomediastinum (PM) in SARS-CoV-2 infections can have a multifaceted presentation. The most frequently described cases of spontaneous PM (SPM) occurred during the first waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to alveolar fragility related to severe cases of interstitial pneumonia and vascular injury that predisposed to alveolar destruction and to the Macklin effect in PM development. Cases of SPM were also reported secondary to non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and to the increasing use of higher doses of corticosteroid therapy. However, true SPM in COVID-19 patients without any identifiable risk factors and presenting as a ""Hamman syndrome"" (HS) has also been observed, although it represents a very rare clinical entity. Both lung dysbiosis and spike protein toxicity could be implicated in SPM, including cases occurring after COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, a variety of clinical entities have been reported that are similar both in COVID-19 infection and after the related COVID-19 vaccination. We present two clinical cases (a 14-year-old boy and his mother), one presenting with SPM and both showing thymic hyperplasia, myasthenic-like symptoms, and long COVID features as a post-vaccination syndrome (PACVS). This report highlights how genetic and familial predisposition could play a role in the thymic response both in COVID-19 infection and after vaccination, involving the toxicity of the spike protein as a common denominator."

High-Flow Nasal Cannula Outside the ICU: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Background: Use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) expanded from ICUs to internal medicine/respiratory wards during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but safety and effectiveness in non-ICU settings remain uncertain. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of adults (>/=18 years) initiated on HFNC in non-ICU wards. Primary outcomes were in-hospital (or 28-day) mortality and ICU transfer; where available, we compared mortality for HFNC vs. conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in do-not-intubate (DNI) cohorts. Observational studies and trials were eligible. Random-effects models synthesized proportions and risk ratios; risk of bias (ROBINS-I/RoB 2) and certainty (GRADE) were assessed. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for any-ward HFNC; subsets contributed data to pooled analyses. Across all non-ICU wards (general wards plus step-up IMCU/HDU), pooled mortality was 14.0% (95% CI 4.6-35.5; I(2)  approximately  92%). Pooled ICU transfer after ward/step-up HFNC start was 20.0% (95% CI 6.3-48.1; I(2)  approximately  97%). Restricted to internal medicine/respiratory wards, pooled mortality was 19.8% (95% CI 7.1-44.2; I(2)  approximately  95%) and ICU transfer 31.2% (95% CI 9.9-65.0; I(2)  approximately  97%). In step-up units (IMCU/HDU), ICU transfer appeared lower and less variable (22.0% [95% CI 16.5-28.8]; I(2)  approximately  10%), suggesting environment-dependent outcomes. In a multicenter DNI COVID-19 cohort, HFNC vs. COT showed no clear mortality difference (RR  approximately  0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.08; adjusted OR  approximately  0.72, 95% CI 0.34-1.54). Certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes was very low due to observational design, high inconsistency, and imprecision. Conclusions: HFNC outside the ICU is feasible, but it is related to nontrivial mortality and frequent escalation-particularly on general wards-while step-up units demonstrate more reproducible trajectories. Outcomes appear strongly conditioned by care environment, staffing, monitoring, and escalation pathways. Given very low certainty and substantial heterogeneity, institutions should pair ward HFNC with protocolized reassessment and rapid response/ICU outreach, and future research should prospectively compare ward HFNC pathways against optimized COT/NIV using standardized outcomes.

Modelling the Transference of Paediatric Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism to Adult Hospitals: Clinical Experience.	Background/Objectives: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are chronic, life-threatening genetic disorders with a significant cumulative prevalence worldwide. Advances in early diagnosis and treatment have significantly increased life expectancy, underscoring the need for specialised adult care units and the establishment of structured transition programmes from paediatric to adult services. We hereby present a functional transition model for IEM patients and share our implementation experience. Methods: Initiated in 2012, the partnership between the paediatric Hospital Sant Joan de Deu (HSJD) and the adult-care centre at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB) culminated in 2019 with the transference of the first IEM patients under the structured A10! Programme. This model is structured around the transition units of paediatric and adult centres to guarantee communication and functional management. Regular monthly meetings at each centre and joint quarterly sessions allowed for protocol harmonisation and personalised care planning. Coordinated engagement of the multidisciplinary health care teams with patients and families smoothed the transfer process. Results: Between 2019 and 2024, 94 IEM patients were successfully transferred. Diagnoses included intermediary metabolism defects (71.23%), lipid metabolism and transport disorders (4.25%), heterocyclic compound metabolism (2.12%), complex molecules and organelle dysfunction (6.37%), cofactor and mineral metabolism (2.12%), signalling defects (5.31%), and unclassified cases (8.51% of rare disorders, maybe non-IEM). Transition formats included 21 in-person joint visits in HSJD, 37 remote transitions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 36 streamlined transfers via standardised protocols. Sessions, trainings, and meetings allowed the exchange of patients' needs and protocols. Conclusions: The successful transference of IEM patients requires structured programmes with interdisciplinary paediatric and adult teams, joining efforts with the patient, families, and caregivers. Communication between paediatric and adult transition units is essential to promote continuity of care and patient empowerment. While constantly updated, this model has proven effective, gaining positive evaluations from healthcare professionals and patients alike, representing a scalable framework for lifelong management of IEM in adult care settings.

Pediatric Maxillofacial Fractures: Patterns of Injury, Surgical Indications, and Treatment Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Study.	Background: Pediatric craniofacial fractures represent a distinct clinical entity characterized by unique anatomical and developmental factors that differentiate them from adult facial trauma. Despite their relative rarity, these injuries pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to the presence of active growth centers and the potential for long-term functional and esthetic sequelae. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted among pediatric patients aged 0-17 years treated for craniofacial fractures between 2020 and 2024 at the Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. Demographic data, injury mechanisms, fracture distribution, treatment modality, and associated injuries were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify predictors of surgical intervention. Results: Ninety-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 12 years, with a male predominance. Midfacial fractures were most common, with orbital floor fractures representing the single most frequent injury. Surgical management was performed in 72 cases, predominantly using the transconjunctival approach and autologous bone grafting. Orbital floor fractures were identified as the only independent predictor of operative treatment (p < 0.05). Central nervous system trauma was the most frequent concomitant injury. No significant changes in etiology or fracture distribution were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Pediatric craniofacial trauma follows a reproducible, age- and mechanism-dependent pattern. Effective management requires individualized, growth-preserving, and function-oriented treatment strategies. Standardization of care protocols and multicenter prospective studies are essential to optimize outcomes and develop evidence-based, age-specific guidelines for the management and prevention of pediatric facial fractures.

Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: IL-6 Dynamics, Inflammatory Phenotypes, and Short-Term Organ-Failure Trajectories in a Real-World Cohort.	Background and Objectives: In severe COVID-19-associated sepsis, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is used as a rescue strategy to modulate cytokine and coagulation derangements, but its biomarker and organ-failure effects remain incompletely characterised. We evaluated peri-procedural changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), other inflammatory markers, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores according to TPE intensity, timing, and inflammatory phenotypes. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study including 102 mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-associated sepsis who received >/=1 TPE session. Patients were grouped by number of sessions (1, 2, >/=3), timing (</=14 vs. >14 days from symptom onset), IL-6 responder status (>/=50% reduction), and two unsupervised inflammatory-thrombotic clusters. Peri-procedural changes (Delta) in biomarkers and SOFA were compared using non-parametric tests, with multivariable logistic and linear regression exploring predictors of IL-6 response and DeltaSOFA. Results: Baseline severity was similar across TPE-intensity groups, with median APACHE II scores of 11-12 and SOFA scores around 7 in all strata. Median IL-6 concentrations declined after TPE in each group (e.g., Delta -59.4 pg/mL after 1 session and Delta -65.1 pg/mL after >/=3 sessions), but between-group differences in DeltaIL-6 were not statistically significant (p = 0.276). By contrast, D-dimer exhibited a marked decline only in the 1-session group (median Delta -1.7 mg/L vs. ~0.0 mg/L in the 2- and >/=3-session groups; p < 0.001). Timing (early vs. late TPE) did not materially affect DeltaIL-6, DeltaCRP, DeltaSOFA (median 0.0 in both), or DeltaD-dimer. Overall, 50% of patients were IL-6 responders; baseline IL-6 was the only independent predictor (adjusted OR 1.9 per doubling, 95% CI 1.3-2.8). A hyperinflammatory-thrombotic cluster (n = 44) exhibited higher baseline IL-6 (612.3 vs. 92.4 pg/mL), more >/=3-session TPE (65.9% vs. 29.3%), and higher IL-6 responder rates (75.0% vs. 31.0%), but similar 28-day mortality (40.9% vs. 29.3%). Conclusions: In this real-world TPE programme, biochemical improvements-particularly IL-6 and D-dimer reductions in hyperinflammatory-thrombotic patients-were not consistently accompanied by short-term SOFA or survival benefits, underscoring the need for phenotype-guided and trial-based use.

Physical Activity Patterns and Behavioral Resilience Among Foggia University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Public Health Perspective.	Background: The (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly disrupted daily routines and physical activity (PA), especially among university students, due to restrictions and limited access to sports facilities. As this group is particularly vulnerable to sedentary lifestyles and mental health issues, understanding their PA patterns is crucial. This study explores overall and domain-specific PA levels and the influence of sociodemographic factors, offering insights for promoting sustainable PA strategies in higher education during and beyond health crises. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among University of Foggia students during the pandemic. The participants completed the validated Italian IPAQ-Long to assess PA across various domains. Associations with demographics and perceived barriers were analyzed via t tests, ANOVA, and nonparametric tests. Results: A total of 301 students completed the survey. Despite barriers such as limited living space, low income, and sports facility closures, 66% of the participants reported high PA levels, mainly through work-related and leisure activities. This remains insufficient. PA varied significantly by gender, income, residence, and employment status: males reported higher leisure PA, whereas females engaged more in active transport and domestic activities. Rural residents and those with moderate incomes demonstrated higher overall PA, whereas employed students presented lower activity levels. These findings underscore the complex socioeconomic and environmental factors shaping PA behavior during an unprecedented global health crisis. Conclusions: The findings reveal that students' resilience in maintaining PA is a coping mechanism despite socioeconomic and environmental barriers. Tailored, accessible PA initiatives integrated into university curricula can enhance student well-being, academic performance, and long-term health during and after public health emergencies. Universities should adopt accessible, equity-oriented PA initiatives to promote physical and mental health and enhance public-health preparedness during future emergencies.

Changes in Psychophysical Parameters in Seniors During the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Repeated Observational Study.	Older individuals primarily belong to the group with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Social distancing and other strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the psychophysical parameters of seniors. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study is to analyze the changes in psychophysical parameters among seniors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic over a one-year observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The observation involved 54 respondents aged 60 and above. The study was conducted three times from March 2020 to April 2021. The selected research method was a diagnostic survey based on a questionnaire. RESULTS: The level of general physical activity in the study groups during the pandemic was determined to be moderate with an upward trend. A downward trend in self-assessment of quality of life was observed, particularly in the area of mental health, along with an increase in symptoms of anxiety, aggression, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic period did not significantly affect the level of physical activity among the surveyed seniors, but an intensification of mental symptoms was noticeable.

Unmet Healthcare Needs in COPD: A Text Network Analysis and Topic Modeling of Pre/Post-COVID-19 Research Trends.	Background/Objectives: Unmet healthcare needs, driven by structural and patient-level barriers, are particularly critical in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, limited research has examined how academic themes on this topic connect and evolve over time. This study analyzed the structure and temporal shifts in research trends on unmet healthcare needs in COPD to identify key concepts and topics and policy implications. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL (12-15 March 2025) to identify English-language abstracts on unmet healthcare needs in COPD. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed articles with an English-language abstract that examined unmet healthcare needs from the patient perspective. In total, 451 abstracts were analyzed using text network analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Topic distributions before and after the coronavirus disease pandemic were assessed using chi-square tests, and findings were interpreted within Penchansky and Thomas's 5A healthcare access framework. Results: Six topics emerged: socioeconomic disparities, early diagnosis and symptom management, guideline-based information and technology use, integrated care for advanced COPD, access to pulmonary rehabilitation, and equitable medication availability. These topics mapped onto all five access dimensions, underscoring the multidimensional nature of unmet healthcare needs. Network analysis identified management, diagnosis, symptoms, exacerbation, and other related terms as central hubs in the discourse. Post-pandemic, research shifted toward digital information delivery, technology adoption, and equitable pharmacotherapy. Conclusions: Findings suggest that reducing unmet healthcare needs in COPD requires integrated systems that address both disease complexity and access barriers. Targeted, multidisciplinary, and policy-driven interventions in highly central domains are needed to reduce disparities and improve outcomes. This study also confirmed a post-pandemic shift in research priorities, emphasizing the need for equitable and adaptive healthcare policies.

Hospital Influenza Outbreak Management in the Post-COVID Era: A Narrative Review of Evolving Practices and Feasibility Considerations.	Background: Hospital-acquired influenza remains a persistent threat that amplifies morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and operational strain, particularly among older and immunocompromised inpatients. The COVID-19 era reshaped control norms-normalizing N95 use during surges, ventilation improvements, and routine multiplex PCR-creating an opportunity to strengthen hospital outbreak management. Methods: We conducted a targeted narrative review of WHO/CDC/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidance and peer-reviewed studies (January 2015-August 2025), emphasizing adult inpatient care. This narrative review synthesizes recent evidence and discusses theoretical implications for practice, rather than establishing formal guidelines. Evidence was synthesized into pragmatic practice statements on detection, diagnostics, isolation/cohorting, antivirals, chemoprophylaxis, vaccination, surveillance, and communication. Results: Early recognition and test-based confirmation are pivotal. For inpatients, nucleic-acid amplification tests are preferred; negative antigen tests warrant PCR confirmation, and lower-respiratory specimens improve yield in severe disease. A practical outbreak threshold is >/=2 epidemiologically linked, laboratory-confirmed cases within 72 h on the same ward. Effective control may require immediate isolation or cohorting with dedicated staff, strict droplet/respiratory protection, and daily active surveillance. Early oseltamivir (</=48 h from onset or on admission) reduces mortality and length of stay; short-course post-exposure prophylaxis for exposed patients or staff lowers secondary attack rates. Integrated vaccination efforts for healthcare personnel and high-risk patients reinforce workforce resilience and reduce transmission. Conclusions: A standardized, clinician-led bundle-early molecular testing, do-not-delay antivirals, decisive cohorting and Personal protective equipment (PPE), targeted chemoprophylaxis, vaccination, and disciplined communication- could help curb transmission, protect vulnerable patients and staff, and preserve capacity. Hospitals should codify COVID-era layered controls for seasonal influenza and rehearse unit-level outbreak playbooks to accelerate response and recovery. These recommendations target clinicians and infection-prevention leaders in acute-care hospitals.

General Health (GHQ-28/CGHQ-28) and Psychosocial Risks (COPSOQ-ISTAS21) in Prehospital Emergency Professionals: A Pre-COVID-19 Cross-Sectional Study in Southern Spain.	Background: Prehospital emergency professionals are exposed to high psychosocial demands that may impact their mental health, but pre-COVID-19 baseline data from Spanish services are scarce. This study aimed to assess the general health and psychosocial risk factors in a regional prehospital emergency service before the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study (September-December 2019) including 51 physicians, nurses, and emergency medical technicians working at the 061 Health Emergency Center in Granada (Andalusia, Spain). General health and chronic problems were assessed with the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28/CGHQ-28), and work-related psychosocial risks were evaluated using the COPSOQ-ISTAS21 questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and exploratory Spearman correlations between health indicators and psychosocial dimensions were performed. Results: Most participants reported good self-perceived general health, but the chronic coding of the GHQ (CGHQ-28) indicated long-term difficulties mainly related to social dysfunction, somatic symptoms, and anxiety/insomnia. Exposure to unfavorable psychosocial risk was frequent, particularly in psychological demands, double presence (work-family conflict), and low esteem, with intermediate-unfavorable patterns in active job/development, insecurity, and social support/leadership. Exploratory correlations suggested that double presence was the psychosocial factor most consistently associated with chronic distress. Conclusions: In this pre-COVID-19 cohort of prehospital emergency professionals, good perceived general health coexisted with chronic psychological strain and high exposure to adverse psychosocial work factors. These findings support the need for organizational measures to reduce psychological demands and work-family conflict and to strengthen social support and leadership in prehospital emergency teams.

Pregnant Women's Experiences of Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.	Background/Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented societal changes globally and negatively impacted the psychosocial health of pregnant women. This study aimed to explore how direct, indirect, and unrelated factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic influenced stress levels among pregnant women. Methods: This interpretivist qualitative study employed open-ended survey questions to capture the lived experiences of 313 pregnant women in the third trimester residing in Florida between January and March 2022, during the Omicron surge. Thematic analysis was conducted, guided by the Stress and Coping Theory and the Stress Buffering Theory. Results: Participants described a range of stressors directly and indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected pregnant women. Themes related to increased stress were (1) fear, worry, and anxiety related to COVID-19 infection, (2) fear, worry, and anxiety related to preparedness for birth/baby due to pandemic restrictions, (3) prevention concerns associated with COVID-19, (4) lack of social support, (5) return to normalcy, (6) health-related social needs, (7) physical health issues, and (8) navigating conflict and grief. Conversely, stress-reducing factors were (1) preventive measures during the pandemic, (2) coping strategies, (3) not having to work, and (4) social support. Conclusions: Pregnant women experienced heightened stress due to a complex interplay of factors related directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important that maternity care, mental health and health-related social needs screenings and referrals, and tailored interventions are integrated into public health crises preparedness plans to limit the stress that pregnant women experience and support their well-being.

Real-Time Fluorescence-Based COVID-19 Diagnosis Using a Lightweight Deep Learning System.	The coronavirus is highly contagious, making rapid early diagnosis essential. Although deep learning-based diagnostic methods using CT or X-ray images have advanced significantly, they still face limitations in cost, processing time, and radiation exposure. In addition, for the possibility of real-time COVID-19 diagnosis, model lightweighting is required. This study proposes a lightweight deep learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on fluorescence images and demonstrates its applicability in embedded environments. To prevent data imbalance caused by noise and experimental variations, images were preprocessed using Gray Scale conversion, CLAHE, and Z-Score normalization to equalize brightness values. Among the tested architectures-VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet-ResNet152 and VGG13 achieved the highest accuracies of 97.25% and 93.58%, respectively, and were selected for lightweighting. Layer-wise importance was calculated using an imprinting-based method, and less important layers were pruned. The pruned VGG13 maintained its accuracy while reducing model size by 18.9 MB and parameters by 4.2 M. ResNet152 (Prune 39) improved accuracy by 1% while reducing size by 161.5 MB and parameters by 40.22 M. The optimized model achieved 129.97 ms, corresponding to 7.69 frames per second (FPS) on an NPU(Furiosa AI Warboy), proving real-time COVID-19 diagnosis is feasible even on low-power edge devices.

Highly Sensitive Detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Human Serum Using Bloch Surface Wave Biosensor.	Accurate and sensitive antibody detection remains critical for advanced COVID-19 diagnostics and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This study presents a highly sensitive technique for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum using an integrated photonic sensing platform. The platform utilizes disposable one-dimensional photonic crystal biochips engineered to sustain Bloch Surface Waves. The biochips are integrated into a custom-made optical set-up, which is capable of dual-mode detection: label-free refractometry and label-based fluorescence. Tests on human serum, including negative controls and positive samples from a recovered COVID-19 patient, confirmed the platform's effective performance. In fluorescence mode, clear discrimination between positive and negative samples was achieved down to a 1:10(4) serum dilution, with an optimal operating range centered around 1:10(3) dilution. These results demonstrate the potential of the technique as a highly sensitive and versatile platform for antibody detection, with significant relevance for advanced COVID-19 diagnostics.

Cognition, Cytokines, Blood-Brain Barrier, and Beyond in COVID-19: A Narrative Review.	Numerous studies report cognitive impairment in COVID-19 patients from the acute to post-acute phases, linked to blood inflammation affecting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and causing leakage of glial and neuronal proteins. However, a clear classification of these cognitive deficits and molecular blood events over time is still lacking. This narrative review summarizes the neuropsychological consequences of COVID-19 and evidence of altered cytokines and BBB disruption as potential mediators of cognitive impairment across post-infection phases. Post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction appears to follow a temporal course, evolving from acute focal deficits in attention, working memory, and executive function to more persistent multidomain impairments. We reviewed key cytokines released into the blood during COVID-19 infection, including antiviral (IFNgamma, CXCL1, CXCL10), inflammatory (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNFalpha), and monocyte chemoattractants (MCP1/CCL2, MCP3/CCL7, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, GM-CSF, G-CSF). This analysis shows that several inflammatory and viral cytokines remain elevated beyond the acute phase and are associated with cognitive deficits, including IL-6, IL-13, IL-8, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and MCP1 in long-term post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, we examined studies analyzing changes over time in neurovascular unit proteins as biomarkers of BBB disruption, including extracellular matrix proteins (PPIA, MMP-9), astrocytes (S100beta, GFAP), and neurons (NFL). These proteins are elevated in acute COVID-19 but generally return to control levels within six months, suggesting BBB restoration. However, in patients followed for over a year, BBB disruption persists only in those with cognitive impairment and is associated with systemic inflammation, with TGFbeta as a related biomarker. Although cognitive sequelae can persist for over 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, further studies are needed to investigate long-term neurocognitive outcomes and their link to sustained proinflammatory cytokine elevation and brain impact.

Vascular Complications of Long COVID-From Endothelial Dysfunction to Systemic Thrombosis: A Systematic Review.	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated not only with respiratory illness but also with profound vascular and coagulation disturbances. Long COVID (LC) is characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, and palpitations. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces direct endothelial injury, promotes a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, and activates platelets, leading to immunothrombosis and impaired fibrinolysis. Consequently, patients exhibit microthrombosis, elevated plasma D-dimer, fibrinogen dysregulation, and persistent hypercoagulability. Clinically, this translates into an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, as well as arterial thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which may persist months after acute infection. Understanding the interplay between endothelial injury, inflammation, and coagulation is crucial for risk stratification and the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. We conducted a systematic narrative review of the literature, including human clinical and mechanistic studies identified through PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science up to 30 September 2025. This review synthesizes current evidence on vascular complications in LC, highlighting endothelial dysfunction as a central pathophysiological nexus linking the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection with chronic LC manifestations.

Natural Fatty Acids as Dual ACE2-Inflammatory Modulators: Integrated Computational Framework for Pandemic Preparedness.	The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in single-target antiviral strategies, highlighting the urgent need for multi-mechanism therapeutic approaches against emerging viral threats. Here, we present an integrated computational framework systematically evaluating natural fatty acids as potential dual ACE2 (Angiotension Converting Enzyme 2)-inflammatory modulators; compounds simultaneously disrupting SARS-CoV-2 viral entry through allosteric ACE2 binding while suppressing host inflammatory cascades; through allosteric binding mechanisms rather than conventional competitive inhibition. Using molecular docking across eight ACE2 regions, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations, MM/PBSA free energy calculations, and multivariate statistical analysis (PCA/LDA), we computationally assessed nine naturally occurring fatty acids representing saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated classes. Hierarchical dynamics analysis identified three distinct binding regimes spanning fast (tau < 50 ns) to slow (tau > 150 ns) timescales, with unsaturated fatty acids demonstrating superior binding affinities (DeltaG = -6.85 +/- 0.27 kcal/mol vs. -6.65 +/- 0.25 kcal/mol for saturated analogs, p = 0.002). Arachidonic acid achieved optimal SwissDock affinity (-7.28 kcal/mol), while oleic acid exhibited top-ranked predicted binding affinity within the computational hierarchy (DeltaG(bind) = -24.12 +/- 7.42 kcal/mol), establishing relative prioritization for experimental validation rather than absolute affinity quantification. Energetic decomposition identified van der Waals interactions as primary binding drivers (65-80% contribution), complemented by hydrogen bonds as transient directional anchors. Comprehensive ADMET profiling predicted favorable safety profiles compared to synthetic antivirals, with omega-3 fatty acids showing minimal nephrotoxicity risks while maintaining excellent intestinal absorption (>91%). Multi-platform bioactivity analysis identified convergent anti-inflammatory mechanisms through eicosanoid pathway modulation and kinase inhibition. This computational investigation positions natural fatty acids as promising candidates for experimental validation in next-generation pandemic preparedness strategies, integrating potential therapeutic efficacy with sustainable sourcing. The framework is generalizable to fatty acids from diverse biological origins.

Immune-Based Biomarkers as Predictors of Mortality in ECMO Therapy for Severe COVID-19 ARDS: Insights from a Retrospective Study.	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a vital intervention for patients with severe respiratory failure, particularly in unresponsive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cases. However, patient selection for ECMO remains a significant challenge. This study aims to identify novel immune-based biomarkers to improve eligibility assessment and predict outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients undergoing ECMO. This monocentric observational retrospective cohort study included 80 patients with severe COVID-19-related pneumonia who required ECMO support due to unresponsive ARDS. The patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of IRCCS-ISMETT Hospital between September 2020 and April 2021, before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. All patients were infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. Using machine learning approaches, the study analyzed clinical and laboratory data, cytokine levels, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and immune cell profiles collected within two days of hospitalization. The analysis identified a 5.56-fold increased mortality risk in patients presenting with a combination of immune factors: a T cell exhaustion profile, low interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) levels, and high calprotectin levels. These immune markers were strongly associated with poorer outcomes in patients undergoing ECMO. Our findings highlight the critical role of immune profiling in ECMO patient selection and outcome prediction. Incorporating immune-based biomarkers into clinical assessments may enhance the evaluation of ECMO eligibility and guide treatment decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Assessment of Nociception and Inflammatory/Tissue Damage Biomarkers in a Post-COVID-19 Animal Model.	Five years after the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, post-COVID-19 condition continues to affect millions of subjects with persistent symptoms that significantly impair quality of life. Post-COVID-19 pain, particularly in women, has emerged as a frequent yet underestimated symptom. The validation and identification of animal models that reproduce persistent symptoms after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The aim of the current study was to evaluate thermal nociception, biomarkers of inflammation, and nerve tissue damage in a female animal model of post-COVID-19 condition. A SARS-CoV-2 infection model was established by intranasal administration of the Omicron variant (BA.1.17 lineage) in transgenic female C57BL/6 mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2). Nociception was assessed using the hot-plate test for 28 days post-infection. Afterwards, animals were sacrificed to analyze plasma inflammatory biomarkers by multiplex analysis. In addition, IL-6, IL-18, and IL-1beta expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry to analyze neural inflammation in the saphenous nerve. The results revealed that heat nociceptive thresholds in infected mice did not significantly differ from those of non-infected, but a trend toward lower thresholds was observed in the infected group (days 14 and 28 post-infection). In addition, a slight modification in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in plasma was detected, but no changes in the expression of IL-6, IL-1beta, or IL-18 were observed in the saphenous nerve. Based on all the analyses conducted, infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce thermal sensitization in animals nor alterations in the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the saphenous nerve. Finally, a slight state of systemic inflammation was present in the infected animals. The absence of detectable changes in this animal model underscores the need for further research to clarify the discrepancies observed in human patients and to explore alternative pathways potentially involved in post-COVID-19 pain syndromes.

The Central Role of Macrophages in Long COVID Pathophysiology.	"This review article attempts to provide a unifying hypothesis to explain the myriad of symptoms and predispositions underlying the development of PASC (Postacute Sequelae of COVID), often referred to as Long COVID. The hypothesis described here proposes that Long COVID is best understood as a disorder of persistent immune dysregulation, with chronic macrophage activation representing the fundamental underlying pathophysiology. Unlike transient post-viral syndromes, Long COVID involves a sustained innate immune response, particularly within monocyte-derived macrophages, driven by persistent spike protein (peripherally in MAIT cells and centrally in Microglial cells), epigenetic imprinting, and gut-related viral reservoirs. These macrophages are not merely activated temporarily but also become epigenetically ""trained"" into a prolonged inflammatory state, as demonstrated by enduring histone acetylation markers such as H3K27acDNA Reprogramming. It is proposed that recognizing macrophage activation as the central axis of Long COVID pathology offers a framework for personalized risk assessment, targeted intervention, and therapeutic recalibration."

A Pilot Study of COVID-19 Outcomes in People Living with HIV in Tatarstan.	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a significant public health threat globally with significant socio-economic impacts. People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) have a high risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 due to immunosuppression. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in HIV patients largely remains unclear. We carried out a pilot study to investigate the clinical laboratory data and circulating cytokines in PLWH infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Tatarstan, Russia. Serum samples were collected from three groups: PLWH with COVID-19 (PLWH/COVID-19), COVID-19-only, and uninfected controls. We found an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in PLWH/COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-only. Four fatal cases were in PLWH/COVID-19, while there was no fatality in COVID-19-only. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-15, were elevated in PLWH/COVID-19 compered to COVID-19-only. These preliminary findings highlight the potential for more severe COVID-19 in PLWH/COVID-19 where pro-inflammatory cytokines could play pathogenic role.

Targeting Host Dependency Factors: A Paradigm Shift in Antiviral Strategy Against RNA Viruses.	RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, pose a persistent threat to global public health. Their high mutation rates undermine the effectiveness of conventional direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and facilitate drug resistance. As obligate intracellular parasites, RNA viruses rely extensively on host cellular machinery and metabolic pathways throughout their life cycle. This dependency has prompted a strategic shift in antiviral research-from targeting the mutable virus to targeting relatively conserved host dependency factors (HDFs). In this review, we systematically analyze how RNA viruses exploit HDFs at each stage of infection: utilizing host receptors for entry; remodeling endomembrane systems to establish replication organelles; hijacking transcriptional, translational, and metabolic systems for genome replication and protein synthesis; and co-opting trafficking and budding machinery for assembly and egress. By comparing strategies across diverse RNA viruses, we highlight the broad-spectrum potential of HDF-targeting approaches, which offer a higher genetic barrier to resistance, providing a rational framework for developing host-targeting antiviral therapies.

Effect of Underwear Materials on the Thermal Insulation of Barrier Protective Clothing.	Medical personnel wearing barrier clothing protecting against infectious agents are at risk of heat stress resulting from limited heat exchange with the environment. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of changing underwear on the thermal parameters of protective clothing sets and on the expected safe working time. The study used a Newton thermal manikin to determine the thermal insulation and water vapor resistance of clothing sets consisting of three types of underwear (standard medical underwear and short and long thermal underwear) worn under two types of barrier suits. The obtained data were used to conduct physiological simulations in the Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) program, estimating the time it takes for core body temperature to rise to 38  degrees C in conditions of 22  degrees C and 35  degrees C. The results showed that replacing medical underwear with thermal underwear at 22  degrees C extended safe working time by 24%. In hot conditions (35  degrees C), the positive impact was smaller, extending working time by a maximum of 4%. Changing the inner layer is an effective method of improving comfort and safety in barrier clothing, especially in thermoneutral conditions.

Single-Use Flexible Bronchoscopy: Advances in Technology and Applications.	With advances in scope and imaging technology, the use of single-use flexible bronchoscopy (SUFB) has broadened beyond intensive care units and operating rooms to bronchoscopy units, with an expanding body of literature suggesting adequate and comparable procedure outcomes, including airway inspection, bronchoalveolar lavage, endobronchial brushing and endobronchial biopsy, in comparison to standard reusable flexible bronchoscopy (RFB). Advantages such as mobility, ease of use and lack of requirement for cleaning staff during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global increase in usage, with many companies developing SUFB as part of their bronchoscopy portfolio. In parallel, there has been more attention and initiatives to minimise the risk of infection transmission related to bronchoscopy. RFB requires maximum adherence to manufacturer-recommended cleaning protocols. However, evidence of transmissible organisms after cleaning is reported in healthcare settings of all types. After initial benchtop, retrospective and single-arm studies, comparative bronchoscopy studies are identifying that SUFB are as versatile and non-inferior to RFB. However, cost-effectiveness and sustainability factors have to be included in deciding the use of SUFB in routine practice.

Cellular Immunological Memory T Cells and IL15RA Gene Polymorphism in COVID-19 Vaccinated Individuals from Southern Brazil.	Background: The development of safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 was crucial for controlling COVID-19 and establishing long-lasting immune memory in the population. Methods: This study evaluated cellular immune memory in individuals vaccinated with different regimens in Rio Grande do Sul using flow cytometry. Additionally, the rs2228059 polymorphism in the IL15RA gene was genotyped. A total of 62 participants were randomly recruited. Results: A decrease in memory T cell subsets in response to SARS-CoV-2 stimuli was observed in total CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells. Regarding the timing of the last vaccine dose, 94.4% of participants had received their final COVID-19 vaccination at least two years prior to recruitment. The rs2228059 polymorphism was genotyped in 443 individuals from the Rio Grande do Sul population. Among participants who received the ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 vaccination regimen and carried the TT genotype, an increase in CD8(+) naive, CD8(+) effector and CD4(+) naive subsets was observed in stimulated cells. Although preliminary, the results suggest no major differences between vaccination regimens. Conclusions: The progressive reduction in memory T cell counts supports the need for booster doses, which is essential not only in the context of new emerging variants but also especially to maintain adequate cellular immune protection.

Long-Term Cardiovascular and Mortality Risk in Patients with Pre-Existing Arrhythmia Post-SARS-CoV-2 Infection.	Background/Objectives: Individuals with arrhythmia who survived COVID-19 could be susceptible to long-term cardiovascular complications and clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults with a history of arrhythmia in the Montefiore Health System (1 January 2016-17 August 2024). COVID-19 status was determined by a positive or negative polymerase-chain-reaction test. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, first-time myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: defined as MI, HF, stroke, or death) > 30 days post-index date. Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models, adjusted for demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, and COVID-19 vaccination variables, were employed. The association of outcomes with blood biomarkers taken at time of infection were also assessed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results: Among the 6830 arrhythmia patients, 985 were hospitalized for COVID-19, 1591 were not hospitalized for COVID-19, and 4254 did not have COVID-19. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.90, 95% confidence-interval [2.08, 4.04]), first-time MI, HF, and MACE compared to controls without COVID-19. No increased risk was observed among non-hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared to controls, except for all-cause mortality. Older age, male sex, Medicaid, and significant comorbidities were associated with the risk of MACE. Elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, low hemoglobin, and low left ventricular ejection fraction during infection were associated with higher future MACE risk. Conclusions. In individuals with arrhythmia, severe COVID-19 is associated with increased long-term risks of mortality and new-onset cardiovascular complications, while mild infection with mortality risk. These findings highlight the need for long-term cardiovascular monitoring in this population.

Evaluation of the Performance of New Fluorescence Immunoassay POCTs for Determining the Value of Vitamin D in Whole Blood.	VD (VD), a hormone-like, fat-soluble molecule, is essential for several biological processes, such as gene regulation, calcium balance, bone health, immune function, antiviral defense, and neuromuscular activity. Its deficiency is associated with various disorders, including chronic hypocalcemia and increased risk of severe diseases, such as COVID-19. Monitoring 25-hydroxyVD (25-OH-D) levels is vital, with serum 25-OH-VD being the standard marker. While chromatography and immunometric assays are well-established, innovative point-of-care (POC) platforms like AFIAS-1((R)) (Boditech & Menarini, Gangwon, Republic of Korea) are emerging as rapid and automated alternatives, particularly advantageous for decentralized settings such as pharmacies, general practitioners' offices, and specialized hospital centers like intensive care units. This study compared AFIAS-1((R)) using whole blood with the gold standard UHPLC-MS/MS using plasma in 50 samples, showing a strong correlation and confirming AFIAS-1((R)) as a reliable method for measuring 25-OH-D levels.

Cyclic Amide-Linked Oxazolidinone Triazoles as Inhibitors of the T-Box Riboswitch.	Antimicrobial resistance remains a critical global health challenge, and was intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this growing threat, novel antibacterial agents targeting unconventional mechanisms are urgently needed. One promising strategy involves inhibiting bacterial riboswitches-RNA elements that regulate gene expression. Unlike most riboswitches that respond to small-molecule metabolites, the T-box riboswitch uniquely binds non-aminoacylated tRNA and is predominantly found in Gram-positive bacteria, making it an attractive target due to its conserved sequences and regulatory role over essential genes. This study explored oxazolidinone- and triazole-based compounds as potential inhibitors of the T-box riboswitch. Prior investigations into tricyclic oxazolidinones revealed an allosteric modulator that effectively inhibited T-box riboswitch transcriptional readthrough in vitro, though it showed limited disruption of the isolated tRNA-antiterminator complex. To enhance RNA-binding affinity and stereoselectivity, a macrocyclic oxazolidinone scaffold was designed, incorporating a strategic substituent to expand the interaction footprint. A synthetically viable candidate was identified, and computational docking studies suggested that one of the designed compounds may interfere with tRNA-induced transcription by forming pi-pi stacking interactions with G5 in the antiterminator region. These findings support the potential of targeting the T-box riboswitch with structurally optimized small molecules as a novel antibacterial strategy.

Beyond Biochemical Markers: Characterizing Malnutrition in COVID-19.	Background/Objective: Malnutrition is common in hospitalized patients and worsens clinical outcomes, particularly in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which inflammation and metabolic disruption contribute to nutritional decline. Thus, identifying simple and accessible markers is essential for early detection and intervention to prevent further deterioration. This study aimed to investigate biochemical and body composition changes during COVID-19 hospitalization and identify key features of hospital-acquired nutritional status disorders. Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study of 66 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between December 2020 and June 2021. Biochemical markers and body composition parameters were measured at admission and at discharge. Deterioration of nutritional status was defined as a weight loss of more than 3% during hospitalization. Results: A total of 66 patients (61% male, aged 56.7 +/- 13.4 years; 39% female, aged 58.8 +/- 12.0 years) were included. Deterioration of nutritional status was observed in 20 (30%) individuals, more likely in men (OR 7.94, 95% CI: 1.28-49.08) and patients with longer hospitalization (OR 1.30 per day, 95% CI: 1.08-1.57). Weight loss was primarily characterized by a reduction in adipose tissue mass, whereas lean tissue mass did not change significantly. Traditional biochemical markers of malnutrition, including low albumin, prealbumin, or cholesterol levels, were not present in this cohort. Conclusions: Our study highlights the significant burden of nutritional deterioration in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and demonstrates its atypical presentation, which may limit the effectiveness of standard malnutrition assessment tools.

Long COVID Patients with Orthostatic Intolerance Have Reduced Heart Rate Variability and Preserved Physiological Response to Active Standing.	The aim of this study was to assess the heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during active orthostatic challenge in long COVID patients with orthostatic intolerance symptoms (dizziness, pre-syncope, and syncope). We performed a cross-sectional, observational, comparative study of 60 subjects of both sexes, aged 18 to 60 years (31 met the criteria of long COVID, 15 were infected individuals without symptoms, and 14 who had neither infection nor symptoms formed the age-matched control group). HRV was obtained from continuous electrocardiograms in a supine position and active standing with spontaneous breathing. The time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to testing in the COVID-19 group was 573 +/- 289 days. The resting (supine position) values of SDNN, RMSSD, SD1, and SD2 were lower in long COVID patients than in control participants, while all other HRV indexes were similar between groups. In response to active standing, both groups had similar changes in all HRV indices. In conclusion, an active orthostatic test was not able to exhibit an autonomic dysregulation in these patients with long COVID, suggesting that cardiac autonomic modulation may have recovered due to the long time that elapsed after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Global Patterns and Temporal Trends in Ovarian and Uterine Cancer Mortality Attributable to High Body-Mass Index, 1990-2023.	Background/Objectives: The risk factors for ovarian and uterine cancer remain insufficiently known. This study aimed to assess global trends in mortality from ovarian and uterine cancer attributable to high body-mass index (BMI) in 1990-2023. Methods: An observational epidemiological study was conducted. The age-standardized rates (ASRs) of mortality were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease study. Trends were evaluated using joinpoint analysis. The Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC, %), with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI), was calculated. Results: Globally, the trend in ASRs of ovarian cancer deaths attributable to high BMI increased significantly (AAPC = +0.4%, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.5). The growth trend in South Asia (AAPC = +8.7%, 95% CI = 8.1 to 9.2) was 30 times greater than in Eastern Europe (AAPC = +0.3%, 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.5). Declining trends in mortality from ovarian cancer were observed only in Australasia (AAPC = -0.2%, 95% CI = -0.4 to -0.1), High-income North America (AAPC = -0.3%, 95% CI = -0.6 to -0.0), and Western Europe (AAPC = -0.7%, 95% CI = -0.8 to -0.6). For uterine cancer, the global trend of mortality also increased (AAPC = +0.1, 95% CI = 0.0 to 0.2), with the trend growing fastest in South Asia (AAPC = +4.2%, 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.4). Decreasing trends in mortality from uterine cancer due to high BMI were observed only in Central Asia (AAPC = -0.6%, 95% CI = -0.9 to -0.4), East Asia (AAPC = -2.2%, 95% CI = -2.6 to -1.8), and Southern Latin America (AAPC = -0.4%, 95% CI = -0.6 to -0.1). Additionally, an accelerated increase in mortality trends for both ovarian and uterine cancer attributable to high BMI was observed in 2020-2023, which corresponds to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Further analytical epidemiological studies are required to clarify the relationship between ovarian and uterine cancer and high BMI.

The decline of 'Deaths of Despair' in Italy: unveiling this phenomenon in a new context.	"BACKGROUND: The term ""Deaths of Despair"" (DoD) refers to mortality due to alcohol consumption, drug use, and suicides. While extensively studied in the United States, where these deaths have markedly increased, less is known about their patterns in other contexts. This study explores the relevance of this concept to Italy, a country with comparatively lower rates, to determine whether these causes of death exhibit common trends and can be meaningfully grouped under a single category. METHODS: We use cause-specific mortality data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics covering the period 1983 to 2018. Data are aggregated by gender and five-year age groups at the NUTS1 regional level. The Potential Gain in Life Expectancy is used to assess the impact of each cause on overall mortality. To explore potential long-term relationships between the causes and across regions, we apply Cointegration Analysis to the time series. RESULTS: The analysis shows a general decline in mortality from causes typically associated with despair in Italy, mainly driven by a reduction in alcohol-related deaths. Drug-related mortality and suicide show more heterogeneous trends across regions and over time. Cointegration Analysis reveals no evidence of long-term dependency among these causes or across regions, with only a few exceptions. This indicates that the observed causes do not share a common underlying temporal structure. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that in the Italian context, deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide do not follow a unified pattern and should not be treated as a single category. Rather, they represent distinct public health issues with different regional trajectories and determinants. As such, they require targeted and differentiated policy responses rather than a unified approach."

Burnout among dental professionals in Pakistan: a post-COVID mixed-methods study of prevalence, predictors, and challenges.	INTRODUCTION: Burnout among dental professionals is a significant mental health concern that affects learning, teaching, and patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified existing stressors, yet little is known about how dental graduates, trainees, and faculty have adapted in the post-pandemic period, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study assessed the prevalence and predictors of burnout among dental professionals and explored their perceptions of post-COVID challenges and coping strategies. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted at the Sindh Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Pakistan, from April 2024 to 3(rd) October 2025. A total of 384 participants completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and responded to open-ended questions on post-COVID job and career challenges. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 26, including reliability testing, factor and regression analyses, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis. RESULTS: The overall Cronbach's alpha for the CBI was 0.87, indicating good reliability. The mean total burnout score was 49.1 (SD = 13.68). Personal burnout was the most prevalent form across all groups, with graduates reporting higher client-related burnout than faculty and postgraduate trainees. Regression analysis revealed that job title was the only significant predictor of burnout (beta = .21, p = .001), while gender, year of graduation, experience, and job sector were not significant. Thematic analysis (n = 82 qualitative responses) identified four main themes: opportunities (digital literacy and tele-dentistry), challenges (workload and emotional strain), skill adaptation (continuous learning and remote communication), and career impact (instability and limited opportunities). CONCLUSION: Burnout remains a significant post-COVID challenge among dental professionals, with personal and client-related dimensions being particularly prominent. Role-specific demands, rather than demographic factors, appear to drive burnout, highlighting the need for targeted institutional support for early-career dental professionals.

Viral kinetics in adults with Covid-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir: a population-based, observational cohort study.	BACKGROUND: This research was motivated by the widespread use of oral antivirals during the Covid-19 pandemic and the remaining uncertainty regarding their effects on viral kinetics, which have rarely been studied in real-world population cohorts of this size. METHODS: We analysed 291,340 SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (CT) values from 113,399 non-hospitalized adult patients in Vienna (01/2022-05/2023), including 30,451 from 12,166 nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients, 27,959 from 10,752 molnupiravir recipients, and 232,930 from 90,481 untreated controls. RESULTS: Both antivirals initially caused a rapid increase in mean CT values. After completion of the 5-day treatment course, CT values declined in both antiviral groups, which was not observed in untreated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide population-level evidence on post-treatment viral kinetics of oral antivirals during the Omicron wave.

Global, regional, and national burdens of anxiety disorders among older adults, 1990-2021: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2021.	PURPOSE: To assess the burden of anxiety disorders in the elderly and temporal trends at global, regional, and national levels during 1990-2021. METHODS: Data on incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of anxiety disorders in the elderly over 60 years old were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. Average annual percentage changes were determined to analyze the trends in age-standardized rates between 1990 and 2021. Correlation between age-standardized rates and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was assessed using Spearman's rank-correlation analysis. We used a meta-regression model to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and DALY rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In 2021, 4.49 million incident cases, 53.07 million prevalent cases, and 5.83 million DALYs were estimated in the elderly worldwide. The age-standardized incidence rate of anxiety disorders in older adults increased slightly, while prevalence and DALY rates remained stable. Middle SDI regions had the highest number of incident cases, prevalent cases, and DALYs, with the highest age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates in high SDI regions. Age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of anxiety disorders were higher among elderly women than men. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence rate of anxiety disorders among older adults rose by 7.82%, while prevalence and DALY rates increased by approximately 6%. CONCLUSION: Over the past three decades, the increasing burden of anxiety disorders among older adults has significantly added to the global mental health challenges. This burden is intensified by socioeconomic factors, especially in middle SDI regions, and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru from 2020 to 2024.	BACKGROUND: Peru recorded one of the world's highest COVID-19 mortality rates, with nearly 4.5 million reported cases and 220,000 deaths by March 2024. Understanding the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in this context is key to informing effective public health responses. This study describes the genomic diversity, transmission dynamics, and geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru from 2020 to 2024. METHODS: We analyzed nearly 50,000 high-quality public SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected nationwide between March 2020 and March 2024. Phylogeographic and mutational analyses were performed to identify variant lineages, trace their origins, and map viral movements within and beyond Peru. RESULTS: We show that Peru's epidemic waves were shaped by the emergence of locally evolved variants, including Lambda (C.37), Gamma (P.1.12), and Omicron (XBB.2.6 and DJ.1) sub-lineages. The city of Lima acted as the primary hub for inter-regional spread, accounting for 47.3% of inferred viral movements to other departments, notably Ancash, Cusco, and Piura. Peru was the source of various lineages that spread internationally, primarily to Chile, the USA, and Europe. Mutational analysis highlighted critical mutations in the spike protein, including L452Q and F490S in Lambda, associated with immune evasion and increased transmissibility. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the capacity of genomic surveillance in Peru to detect and track emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, providing insights into regional and global transmission dynamics in a high-transmission, middle-income country setting. Sustained, cost-effective genomic monitoring, combined with strengthened bioinformatics and laboratory capacity, is essential for pandemic preparedness in resource-limited settings.

Global Burden of Pediatric Cardiovascular Diseases of Congenital and Non-Congenital Trends from 1992 to 2021.	BACKGROUND: Heart diseases in children and teenagers, including congenital and non-congenital cardiovascular diseases remain major causes of illness and death worldwide. Yet, long-term patterns and recent changes are poorly understood. This study explores global trends and inequalities in their burden. METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study to examine incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years among people younger than 20 years across 204 countries from 1992 to 2021. We examined trends over time and used statistical models to see how age, historical period, and year of birth influence the risk of pediatric heart diseases. RESULTS: Here we show that in 2021, there are 2.64 billion people under 20 years of age, mainly in countries with lower income and education levels. Heart diseases cause 309,000 deaths and 28.7 million years of healthy life lost. Congenital heart disease accounts for most deaths, while non-congenital heart disease is more common overall and rises by over one-third since 1992, with sharper increases after 2019. Death rates in poorer regions are up to eight times higher than in richer regions. Although the overall death rate declines by 55 %, adolescents and individuals born more recently face increasing risk for non-congenital conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of heart disease in the young remains heavy, with significant regional and socioeconomic inequalities. Stronger prevention, earlier detection, and better health care are urgently needed, especially in disadvantaged regions and in the years after the coronavirus pandemic.

Virus-induced endothelial senescence as a cause and driving factor for ME/CFS and long COVID: mediated by a dysfunctional immune system.	Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID are two post-viral diseases, which share many common symptoms and pathophysiological alterations. Yet a mechanistic explanation of disease induction and maintenance is lacking. This hinders the discovery and implementation of biomarkers and treatment options, and ultimately the establishment of effective clinical resolution. Here, we propose that acute viral infection results in (in)direct endothelial dysfunction and senescence, which at the blood-brain barrier, cerebral arteries, gastrointestinal tract, and skeletal muscle can explain symptoms. The endothelial senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is proinflammatory, pro-oxidative, procoagulant, primed for vasoconstriction, and characterized by impaired regulation of tissue repair, but also leads to dysregulated inflammatory processes. Immune abnormalities in ME/CFS and long COVID can account for the persistence of endothelial senescence long past the acute infection by preventing their clearance, thereby providing a mechanism for the chronic nature of ME/CFS and long COVID. The systemic and tissue-specific effects of endothelial senescence can thus explain the multisystem involvement in and subtypes of ME/CFS and long COVID, including dysregulated blood flow and perfusion deficits. This can occur in all tissues, but especially the brain as evidenced by findings of reduced cerebral blood flow and impaired perfusion of various brain regions, post-exertional malaise (PEM), gastrointestinal disturbances, and fatigue. Paramount to this theory is the affected endothelium, and the bidirectional sustainment of immune abnormalities and endothelial senescence. The recognition of endothelial cell dysfunction and senescence as a core element in the aetiology of both ME/CFS and Long COVID should aid in the establishment of effective biomarkers and treatment regimens.

Refining the Radiologic Recognition of Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: A Crazy-Paving Pattern Approach.	Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare airspace disease classically associated with the crazy-paving pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). While highly suggestive, this imaging pattern is not pathognomonic and appears across a wide spectrum of pulmonary pathologies. In this review, we adopt a phenotype-first approach, using representative imaging cases to walk the reader through the differential diagnosis of crazy-paving, with attention to radiologic distribution, clinical context, and disease acuity. We emphasize distinguishing features between PAP and its mimics-including pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, organizing pneumonia, mucinous adenocarcinoma, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, acute fulminant PAP, and COVID-19 pneumonia-using side-by-side imaging and contextual pearls. Special attention is given to the radiologic clues favoring autoimmune versus secondary PAP, including geographic distribution of ground-glass opacities, subpleural sparing, and lower lobe predominance. The review concludes with a summary of diagnostic strategies, pathologic correlation, and treatment options, including insights from post-pandemic diagnostic pitfalls. This pattern-based framework is designed for the radiologist and serves as a practical guide for recognizing PAP within the broader spectrum of airspace diseases.

Primary care for depression before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective pre-post study.	OBJECTIVES: To compare primary care for depression among patients detected in the first 21 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to patients detected pre-pandemic, and examine whether depression care was associated with patient characteristics. DESIGN: Retrospective pre-post study using de-identified data from electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). SETTING: Primary care clinics enrolled in CPCSSN from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021. POPULATION: Patients with a valid CPCSSN case definition of depression detected between 01 January 2018 and 31 December 2021 were included in the cohort and categorised by detection date (pre-pandemic or during Canadian pandemic waves). OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary care encounters, psychotropic prescriptions and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescriptions were observed at 3 and 12 months post-detection. Multivariable regression evaluated associations between patients' depression detection timing and depression care, adjusting for age, sex, rurality, neighbourhood deprivation quintile, province, number of observable comorbidities and pre-detection psychotropic use. RESULTS: 91 453 patients with depression were identified, of whom 53% were detected pre-pandemic. Patients detected during the pandemic were younger and less comorbid than those detected pre-pandemic. Proportions of patients with any encounter, psychotropic prescriptions and SSRI prescriptions were higher for patients detected during every pandemic wave compared with patients detected pre-pandemic. The adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) of number of encounters (aIRR=1.15; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.17), psychotropics (aIRR=1.11, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.13) and SSRIs prescribed (aIRR=1.12; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.15) within 3 months of detection were higher among patients detected during the first pandemic wave compared with those detected pre-pandemic. Socio-demographic characteristics had weaker associations with outcomes compared with timing of detection. Results were similar within 12 months of detection. CONCLUSION: Overall, primary care for depression was maintained during the pandemic despite challenging circumstances. Increases in paediatric encounter rates and increased prescribing in younger adults warrant further investigation to understand the factors driving these patterns.
